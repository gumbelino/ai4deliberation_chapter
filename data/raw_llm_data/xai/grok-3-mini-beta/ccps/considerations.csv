cuid,created_at,provider,model,temperature,input_tokens,output_tokens,C1. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.,C2. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.,"C3. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?",C4. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.,C5. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.,C6. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.,C7. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.,C8. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.,C9. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.,C10. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.,C11. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.,C12. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.,"C13. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.","C14. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.",C15. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.,C16. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.,C17. We can adapt to the coming changes.,C18. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.,C19. I care about the planet.,"C20. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.",C21. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.,C22. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. ,C23. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.,"C24. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.","C25. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.",C26. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.,"C27. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.","C28. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.",C29. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.,C30. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.,"C31. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.",C32. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.,C33. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
