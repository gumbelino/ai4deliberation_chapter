## [Considerations]:
1. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
2. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
3. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
4. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
5. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
6. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
7. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
8. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
9. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
10. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
11. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
12. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
13. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
14. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
15. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
16. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
17. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
18. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
19. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
20. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
21. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
22. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
23. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
24. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
25. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
26. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
27. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
28. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
29. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
30. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
31. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
32. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
33. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
34. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
35. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
36. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
37. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
38. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
39. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
40. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
41. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
42. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
43. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”","1. 7

32. I don't know if improving the Bloomfield Track would lead to a rapid acceleration of development in the area to the detriment of the environment.
33. I don't know how, but I think that there must be some way in which everybody benefits from protecting the rainforest near the Bloomfield Track.
34. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track is permanently damaging the coral reefs that fringe the beaches below
35. The Wujal Wujal Community is better off now that the Bloomfield Track has been built.

## [Considerations]:
1. People get the government they deserve
2. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
3. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
4. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
5. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
6. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
7. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
8. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
9. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
10. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
11. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
12. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
13. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
14. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
15. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
16. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
17. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
18. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
19. We live in a great democracy.
20. We are a democratic country.
21. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
22. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
23. I'm always cynical about government processes.
24. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
25. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
26. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
27. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
28. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
29. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
30. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
31. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
32. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
33. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
34. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
35. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
36. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
37. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
38. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
39. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
40. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
41. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
42. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
43. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
44. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
45. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
46. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
47. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
48. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.","1. 7

17. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
18. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
19. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
20. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
21. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
22. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
23. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
24. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
25. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
26. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
27. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
28. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
29. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
30. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
31. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
32. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
33. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
34. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
35. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
36. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
37. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
38. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
39. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
40. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
41. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
42. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.

44. We live in a great democracy.
45. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
46. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.

8. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
9. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
10. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
11. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.

13. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
14. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
15. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
16. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
17. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
18. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
19. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
20. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
21. I'm always cynical about government processes.
22. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
23. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
24. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
25. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.

28. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.

1. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
2. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
3. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
4. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
5. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
6. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
7. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
8. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
9. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
10. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
11. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
12. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
13. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
14. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
15. People get the government they deserve
16. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
17. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
18. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
19. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
20. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
21. I'm always cynical about government processes.
22. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
23. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
24. We are a democratic country.
25. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
26. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
27. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
28. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
29. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
30. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
31. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
32. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
33. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
34. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
35. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
36. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
37. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
38. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
39. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
40. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
41. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
42. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
43. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
44. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
45. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.

## [Considerations]:
1. We are a democratic country.
2. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
3. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
4. We live in a great democracy.
5. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
6. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
7. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
8. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
9. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
10. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
11. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
12. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
13. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
14. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
15. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
16. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
17. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
18. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
19. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
20. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
21. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
22. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
23. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
24. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
25. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
26. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
27. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
28. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
29. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
30. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
31. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
32. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
33. People get the government they deserve
34. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
35. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
36. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
37. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
38. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
39. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
40. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
41. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
42. I'm always cynical about government processes.
43. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
44. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
45. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
46. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
47. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.

1. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
2. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
3. I'm always cynical about government processes.
4. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
5. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
6. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
7. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
8. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
9. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
10. We are a democratic country.
11. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
12. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
13. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
14. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
15. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
16. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
17. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
18. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
19. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
20. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
21. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
22. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
23. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
24. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
25. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
26. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
27. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
28. People get the government they deserve
29. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
30. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
31. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
32. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
33. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
34. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
35. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
36. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
37. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
38. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
39. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
40. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
41. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
42. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
43. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
44. We live in a great democracy.
45. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
46. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
47. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.

## [Considerations]:
1. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
2. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
3. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
4. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
5. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
6. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
7. People get the government they deserve
8. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
9. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
10. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
11. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
12. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
13. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
14. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
15. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
16. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
17. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
18. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
19. We live in a great democracy.
20. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
21. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
22. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
23. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
24. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
25. I'm always cynical about government processes.
26. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
27. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
28. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
29. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
30. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
31. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
32. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
33. We are a democratic country.
34. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
35. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
36. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
37. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
38. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
39. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
40. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
41. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
42. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
43. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
44. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
45. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
46. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
47. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
48. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
2. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
3. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
4. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
5. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
6. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
7. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
8. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
9. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
10. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
11. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
12. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
13. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
14. I'm always cynical about government processes.
15. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
16. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
17. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
18. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
19. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
20. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
21. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
22. People get the government they deserve
23. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
24. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
25. We are a democratic country.
26. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
27. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
28. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
29. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
30. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
31. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
32. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
33. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
34. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
35. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
36. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
37. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
38. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
39. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
40. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
41. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
42. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
43. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
44. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
45. We live in a great democracy.
46. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
47. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
48. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.","1. 11

## [Considerations]:
1. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
2. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
3. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
4. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
5. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
6. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
7. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
8. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
9. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
10. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
11. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
12. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
13. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
14. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
15. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
16. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
17. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
18. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
19. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
20. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
21. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
22. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
23. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
24. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
25. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
26. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
27. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
28. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
29. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
30. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
31. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
32. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
33. We are a democratic country.
34. I'm always cynical about government processes.
35. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
36. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
37. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
38. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
39. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
40. We live in a great democracy.
41. People get the government they deserve
42. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
43. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
44. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
45. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
46. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
47. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
48. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.","1. 10

## [Considerations]:
1. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
2. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
3. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
4. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
5. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
6. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
7. We live in a great democracy.
8. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
9. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
10. We are a democratic country.
11. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
12. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
13. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
14. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
15. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
16. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
17. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
18. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
19. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
20. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
21. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
22. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
23. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
24. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
25. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
26. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
27. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
28. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
29. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
30. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
31. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
32. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
33. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
34. I'm always cynical about government processes.
35. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
36. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
37. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
38. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
39. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
40. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
41. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
42. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
43. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
44. People get the government they deserve
45. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
46. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
47. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
48. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
2. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
3. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
4. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
5. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
6. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
7. I care about the planet.
8. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
9. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
10. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
11. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
12. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
13. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
14. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
15. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
16. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
17. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
18. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
19. We can adapt to the coming changes.
20. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
21. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
22. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
23. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
24. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
25. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
26. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
27. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
28. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
29. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
30. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
31. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
32. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.

## [Considerations]:
1. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
2. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
3. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
4. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
5. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
6. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
7. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
8. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
9. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
10. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
11. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
12. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
13. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
14. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
15. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
16. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
17. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
18. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
19. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
20. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
21. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
22. I care about the planet.
23. We can adapt to the coming changes.
24. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
25. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
26. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
27. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
28. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
29. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
30. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
31. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.

## [Considerations]:
1. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
2. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
3. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
4. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
5. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
6. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
7. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
8. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
9. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
10. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
11. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
12. We can adapt to the coming changes.
13. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
14. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
15. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
16. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
17. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
18. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
19. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
20. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
21. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
22. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
23. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
24. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
25. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
26. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
27. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
28. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
29. I care about the planet.
30. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
31. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
32. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.

2. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
3. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
4. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
5. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
6. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
7. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
8. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
9. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
10. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
11. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
12. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
13. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
14. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
15. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
16. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
17. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
18. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
19. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
20. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
21. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
22. I care about the planet.
23. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
24. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
25. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
26. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
27. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
28. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
29. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
30. We can adapt to the coming changes.
31. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
32. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
33. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.","1. 10

## [Considerations]:
1. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
2. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
3. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
4. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
5. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
6. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
7. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
8. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
9. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
10. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
11. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
12. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
13. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
14. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
15. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
16. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
17. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
18. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
19. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
20. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
21. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
22. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
23. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
24. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
25. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
26. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
27. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
28. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
29. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
30. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
31. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
32. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
33. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
34. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
35. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
36. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
37. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
38. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
39. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
40. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
41. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
42. Forest health means jobs.
43. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
44. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
45. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. ","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
2. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
3. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
4. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
5. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
6. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
7. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
8. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
9. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
10. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
11. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
12. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
13. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
14. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
15. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
16. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
17. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
18. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
19. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
20. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
21. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
22. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
23. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
24. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
25. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
26. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
27. Forest health means jobs.
28. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
29. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
30. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
31. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
32. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
33. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
34. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
35. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
36. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
37. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
38. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
39. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
40. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
41. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
42. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
43. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
44. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
45. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. ","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
2. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
3. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
4. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
5. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
6. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
7. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
8. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
9. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
10. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
11. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
12. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
13. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
14. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
15. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
16. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
17. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
18. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
19. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
20. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
21. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
22. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
23. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
24. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
25. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
26. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
27. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
28. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
29. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
30. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
31. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
32. Forest health means jobs.
33. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
34. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
35. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
36. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
37. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
38. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
39. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
40. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
41. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
42. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
43. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
44. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.

## [Considerations]:
1. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
2. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
3. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
4. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
5. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
6. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
7. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
8. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
9. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
10. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
11. Forest health means jobs.
12. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
13. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
14. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
15. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
16. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
17. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
18. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
19. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
20. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
21. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
22. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
23. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
24. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
25. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
26. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
27. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
28. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
29. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
30. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
31. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
32. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
33. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
34. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
35. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
36. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
37. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
38. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
39. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
40. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
41. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
42. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
43. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
44. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
45. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.","1. 4

33. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
34. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
35. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
36. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
37. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
38. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
39. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
40. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
41. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.

## [Considerations]:
1. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
2. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
3. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
4. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
5. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
6. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
7. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
8. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
9. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
10. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
11. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
12. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
13. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
14. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
15. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
16. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
17. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
18. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
19. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
20. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
21. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
22. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
23. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
24. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
25. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
26. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
27. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
28. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
29. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
30. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
31. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
32. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
33. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
34. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
35. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
36. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
37. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
38. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
39. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
40. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
41. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
42. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
43. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
44. Forest health means jobs.
45. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. ","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
2. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
3. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
4. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
5. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
6. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
7. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
8. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
9. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
10. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
11. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
12. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
13. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
14. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
15. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
16. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
17. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
18. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
19. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
20. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
21. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
22. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
23. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
24. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
25. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
26. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
27. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
28. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
29. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
30. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
31. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
32. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
33. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
34. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
35. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
36. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
37. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
38. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
39. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
40. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
41. Forest health means jobs.
42. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
43. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
44. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
45. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. ","1. 9

2. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
3. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
4. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
5. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
6. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
7. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
8. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
9. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
10. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
11. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
12. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
13. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
14. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
15. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
16. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
17. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
18. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
19. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
20. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
21. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
22. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
23. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
24. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
25. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
26. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
27. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
28. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
29. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
30. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
31. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
32. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
33. Forest health means jobs.
34. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
35. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
36. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
37. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
38. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
39. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
40. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
41. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
42. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
43. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
44. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
45. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.","1. 7

2. Biobanks need independent review boards to determine who should have access to samples. 
3. Participants who donate their samples for research should be given special access to the treatments and therapies that result from that research. 
4. Scientists should have access to all unidentified, personal samples for research.
5. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health.
6. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government. 
7. The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  
8. Participants should be contacted every time researchers want to use their samples for research.
9. My personal sample should never be anonymized since I should be informed of important research results.  
10. If someone is a carrier of a genetic disease, they have a responsibility to participate in genetic research.
11. I do not care if my donated sample is connected to my name and medical information.
12. Genetic studies of race on enthocultural communities will lead to the discrimination of those same enthocultural communities. 
13. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
14. Educating people about health issues (e.g. diet and lifestyle changes) promises greater health effects than investing in biobanks.
15. Genetic studies of disability will lead to the discrimination of people living with the same conditions.
16. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.  
17. Everyone should donate samples to a biobank for the benefit of everyone. 
18. There is no point in consulting the public about ethical issues in science and technology.
19. Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.
20. Genetic information is different from health information. 
21. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
22. Biobanks will only lead to expensive treatments and high profits. 
23. Participants should be active in the set up and oversight of  biobanks. 
24. Aboriginal communities require special consideration concerning healthcare and research.
25. Profits from biobanking should be returned to the donating community.

## [Considerations]:
1. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
2. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
3. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
4. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
5. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
6. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
7. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
8. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
9. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
10. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
11. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
12. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
13. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
14. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
15. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
16. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
17. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
18. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
19. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
20. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
21. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
22. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
23. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
24. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
25. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
26. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
27. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.

## [Considerations]:
1. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
2. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
3. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
4. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
5. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
6. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
7. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
8. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
9. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
10. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
11. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
12. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
13. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
14. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
15. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
16. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
17. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
18. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
19. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
20. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
21. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
22. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
23. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
24. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
25. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
26. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
27. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.

1. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
2. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
3. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
4. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
5. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
6. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
7. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
8. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
9. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
10. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
11. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
12. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
13. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
14. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
15. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
16. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
17. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
18. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
19. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
20. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
21. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
22. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
23. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
24. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
25. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
26. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
27. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
28. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
29. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
30. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.

## [Considerations]:
1. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
2. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
3. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
4. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
5. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
6. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
7. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
8. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
9. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
10. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
11. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
12. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
13. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
14. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
15. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
16. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
17. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
18. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
19. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
20. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
21. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
22. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
23. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
24. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
25. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
26. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
27. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
28. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
29. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
30. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.

## [Considerations]:
1. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
2. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
3. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
4. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
5. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
6. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
7. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
8. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
9. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
10. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
11. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
12. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
13. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
14. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
15. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
16. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
17. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
18. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
19. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
20. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
21. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
22. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
23. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
24. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
25. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
26. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
27. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
28. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
29. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
30. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.

## [Considerations]:
1. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
2. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
3. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
4. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
5. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
6. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
7. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
8. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
9. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
10. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
11. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
12. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
13. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
14. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
15. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
16. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
17. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
18. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
19. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
20. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
21. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
22. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
23. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
24. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
25. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
26. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
27. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
28. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
29. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
30. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
31. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.","1. 7

8. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
9. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
10. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
11. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
12. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
13. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
14. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
15. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
16. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
17. Food waste is a major environmental issue
18. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
19. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
20. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)

## [Considerations]:
1. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
2. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
3. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
4. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
5. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
6. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
7. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
8. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
9. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
10. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
11. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
12. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
13. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
14. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
15. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
16. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
17. Food waste is a major environmental issue
18. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
19. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
20. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
21. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
22. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
23. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
24. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
25. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming

27. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
28. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
29. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)

## [Considerations]:
1. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
2. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
3. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
4. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
5. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
6. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
7. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
8. Food waste is a major environmental issue
9. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
10. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
11. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
12. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
13. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
14. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
15. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
16. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
17. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
18. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
19. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
20. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
21. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
22. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
23. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
24. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
25. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
26. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture

## [Considerations]:
1. Food waste is a major environmental issue
2. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
3. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
4. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
5. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
6. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
7. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
8. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
9. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
10. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
11. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
12. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
13. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
14. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
15. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
16. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
17. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
18. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
19. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
20. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
21. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
22. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
23. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
24. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
25. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
26. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
27. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
28. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.

2. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
3. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
4. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
5. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
6. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
7. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
8. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
9. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
10. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
11. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
12. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
13. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
14. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
15. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
16. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
17. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
18. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
19. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
20. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
21. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
22. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
23. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.

13. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
14. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
15. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
16. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
17. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
18. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
19. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.

## [Considerations]:
1. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
2. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
3. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
4. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
5. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
6. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
7. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
8. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
9. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
10. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
11. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
12. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
13. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
14. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
15. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
16. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
17. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
18. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
19. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
20. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
21. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
22. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
23. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
24. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
25. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
26. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
27. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
28. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
29. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
30. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
31. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).

1. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
2. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
3. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
4. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
5. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
6. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
7. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
8. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
9. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
10. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
11. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
12. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
13. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
14. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
15. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
16. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
17. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
18. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
19. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
20. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
21. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
22. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
23. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
24. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
25. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
26. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
27. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
28. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
29. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
2. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
3. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
4. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
5. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
6. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
7. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
8. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
9. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
10. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
11. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
12. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
13. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
14. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
15. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
16. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
17. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
18. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
19. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
20. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
21. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
22. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
23. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
24. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
25. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
26. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
27. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
28. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
29. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
30. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
31. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.

1. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
2. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
3. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
4. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
5. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
6. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
7. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
8. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
9. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
10. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
11. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
12. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
13. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
14. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
15. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
16. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
17. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
18. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
19. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
20. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
21. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
22. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
23. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
24. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
25. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
26. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
27. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
28. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
29. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
30. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.

14. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
15. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
16. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
17. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
18. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
19. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.

1. As long as there is a bridge that I can cross, I don't care about its structure.
2. We shouldn't stick to the past when deciding about the future of the bridge, we should be open for modern design options.
3. The bridge has stood the test of time for the past 67 years; there's no need for major changes to it.
4. It is worth spending money to retain the iconic status of the bridge.
5. The function of the Fremantle Bridge as a transport gateway is more important than its heritage.
6. Indigenous people would want to minimize impact on the Swan River, a registered site, that is of importance and significance to them.
7. River craft deserve better traffic conditions on the Swan River.
8. We should definitely preserve the heritage value of the bridge, but only if it is financially viable.
9. The most important thing is that access to Fremantle from its north is maintained in the most undisturbed manner as possible. 
10. Reducing the risk of vessel collision on the Swan River should be the main consideration when deciding about the future of the bridge
11. Replacing timber elements with steel components would destroy the authentic appearance of the bridge.
12. When deciding about the future of the bridge, indigenous concerns should be given adequate consideration. 
13. This magnificent timber bridge is a rare and beautiful sight in today's world, it should be preserved. 
14. Alterations will lead to nothing but the uglification of the bridge.
15. The old bridge provides a scenic entrance to Fremantle that attracts tourists.
16. The critical infrastructure of the bridge raises serious safety concerns. 
17. The Fremantle Traffic Bridge is the most iconic landmark and the main tourist attraction in Fremantle. 
18. The bridge is certainly an attractive entry statement to Fremantle and without doubt far more important than trucks.
19. Tax payers money should be spent on services that are more essential than upgrading the bridge.
20. The old bridge will never be able to handle vehicles, bike and pedestrians at the same time.
21. We just got traffic calming in Town Centre after 25 years effort. I don't want bridge to be build bigger, better faster to reverse the gains of the last 25 years.
22. Altering or replacing the existing Fremantle Bridge means diminishing Fremantle.
23. Whatever works are undertaken, the heritage value of the old bridge will be affected.
24. The most important issue for cyclists is safety, which means they need access across the bridge which has a good surface.
25. There are no specific economic benefits for the Fremantle from the bridge.
26. The main concern is to have a bridge that underpins the economic activities in the region.
27. The cost of maintaining the old timber structure is too high.
28. The safety of the bridge is more important than its appearance.
29. It is most important that the solution is a long term one.
30. The problem is not the vulnerable structure of the bridge but excessive traffic, which should be reduced.
31. The existing bridge is too low; archways too narrow and do not line up with the railway bridge making navigation dangerous. 
32. Safe and efficient movement of all road and river users across and under the bridge should the main considerations
33. Since the traffic bridge has important heritage significance, the only grounds for its removal should be on the grounds of serious safety issues and verified by heritage engineers.
34. Any changes to the bridge should give right consideration to the environment.bridge
35. The Fremantle Bridge is irreplaceable. It is a strong, enduring part of our history.
36. Providing a better pedestrian and cycle traffic should be the main consideration when deciding about the future of the bridge.","1. 11

1. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
2. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
3. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
4. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
5. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
6. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
7. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
8. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
9. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
10. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
11. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
12. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
13. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.

1. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
2. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
3. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
4. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
5. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
6. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
7. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
8. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
9. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
10. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
11. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
12. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
13. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
14. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
15. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
16. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
17. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
18. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.

1. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
2. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
3. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
4. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
5. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
6. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
7. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
8. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.

1. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
2. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
3. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
4. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
5. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
6. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
7. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
8. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
9. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
10. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
11. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.

13. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
14. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
15. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
16. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
17. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
18. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
19. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
20. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
2. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
3. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
4. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
5. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
6. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
7. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
8. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
9. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
10. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
11. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
12. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
13. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
14. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
15. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
16. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
17. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
18. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
19. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
20. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
2. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
3. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
4. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
5. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
6. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
7. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
8. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
9. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
10. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
11. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
12. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
13. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
14. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
15. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
16. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
17. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
18. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
19. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
20. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
21. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
22. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
23. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
24. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
25. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
26. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
27. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
28. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
29. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
30. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
31. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
32. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
33. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
34. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
35. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
36. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
37. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
38. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
39. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
40. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
41. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
42. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
43. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.","1. 2

13. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
14. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
15. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
16. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
17. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
18. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
19. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
20. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
21. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
22. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
23. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
24. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.

## [Considerations]:
1. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
2. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
3. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
4. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
5. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
6. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
7. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
8. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
9. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
10. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
11. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
12. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
13. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
14. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
15. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
16. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
17. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
18. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
19. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
20. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
21. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
22. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
23. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
24. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
25. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
26. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
27. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
28. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
29. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
30. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
31. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
32. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
33. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
34. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
35. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
36. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
37. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
38. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
39. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
40. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
41. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.

## [Considerations]:
1. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
2. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
3. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
4. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
5. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
6. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
7. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
8. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
9. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
10. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
11. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
12. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
13. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
14. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
15. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
16. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
17. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
18. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
19. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
20. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
21. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
22. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
23. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
24. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
25. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
26. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
27. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
28. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
29. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
30. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
31. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
32. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
33. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
34. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
35. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
36. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
37. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
38. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
39. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
40. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
41. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
42. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.

## [Considerations]:
1. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
2. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
3. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
4. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
5. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
6. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
7. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
8. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
9. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
10. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
11. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
12. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
13. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
14. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
15. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
16. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
17. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
18. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
19. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
20. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
21. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
22. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
23. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
24. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
25. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
26. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
27. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
28. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
29. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
30. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
31. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
32. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
33. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
34. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
35. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
36. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
37. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
38. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
39. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
40. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
41. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
42. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
43. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
2. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
3. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
4. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
5. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
6. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
7. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
8. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
9. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
10. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
11. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
12. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
13. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
14. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
15. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
16. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
17. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
18. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
19. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
20. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
21. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
22. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
23. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
24. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
25. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
26. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
27. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
28. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
29. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
30. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
31. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
32. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
33. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
34. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
35. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
36. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
37. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
38. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
39. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
40. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
41. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
42. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
43. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. ","1. 5

3. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
4. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
5. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
6. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
7. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
8. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
9. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
10. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
11. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
12. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
13. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
14. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
15. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
16. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
17. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
18. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
19. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
20. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
21. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
22. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
23. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
24. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
25. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
26. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
27. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
28. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
29. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
30. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
31. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.

33. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
34. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
35. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
36. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
37. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.

## [Considerations]:
1. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
2. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
3. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
4. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
5. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
6. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
7. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
8. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
9. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
10. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
11. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
12. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
13. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
14. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
15. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
16. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
17. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
18. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
19. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
20. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
21. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
22. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
23. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
24. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
25. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
26. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
27. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
28. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
29. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
30. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
31. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
32. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
33. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
34. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
35. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
36. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
37. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
38. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
39. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
40. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
41. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
42. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
43. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.","1. 4

## [Considerations]:
1. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
2. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
3. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
4. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
5. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
6. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
7. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
8. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
9. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
10. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
11. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
12. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
13. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
14. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
15. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
16. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
17.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
18. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
19. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
20. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
21. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
22. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
23. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
24. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
25. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
26. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
27. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
28. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
29. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
30. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
31. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
32. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
33. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
34. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
35. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
36. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
37. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
38. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
39. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
40. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
41. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
42. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
43. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
44. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
45. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.","1. 9

5. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
6. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
7. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
8. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
9. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
10. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
11. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
12. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
13. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
14. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
15. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
16. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
17. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
18. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
19. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
20. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
21. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
22. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
23. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
24. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
25. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
26. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
27. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
28. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
29.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
30. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
31. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
32. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
33. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
34. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
35. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
36. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
37. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
38. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
39. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
40. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
41. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
42. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
43. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
44. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
45. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.","1. 7

1. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
2. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
3. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
4. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
5. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
6. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.

12. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.

14. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
15. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
16. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
17. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
18. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
19. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
20. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
21. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
22. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
23. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
24. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
25. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
26. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
27. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
28. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
29. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
30. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
31. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
32. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
33. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
34. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
35. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
36. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
37. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.

## [Considerations]:
1. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
2. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
3. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
4. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
5. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
6. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
7. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
8. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
9. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
10. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
11. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
12. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
13. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
14. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
15. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
16. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
17. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
18. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
19. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
20. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
21. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
22. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
23. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
24. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
25. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
26. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
27. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
28. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
29. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
30.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
31. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
32. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
33. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
34. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
35. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
36. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
37. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
38. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
39. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
40. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
41. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
42. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
43. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
44. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
45. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
2. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
3. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
4. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
5. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
6. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
7. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
8. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
9. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
10. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
11. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
12. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
13. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
14. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
15. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
16. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
17. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
18. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
19. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
20. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
21. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
22. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
23. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
24. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
25. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
26. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
27. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
28. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
29. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
30. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
31. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
32. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
33. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
34.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
35. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
36. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
37. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
38. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
39. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
40. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
41. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
42. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
43. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
44. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
45. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
2. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
3. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
4. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
5. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
6. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
7. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
8. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
9. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
10. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
11. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
12. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
13. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
14. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
15. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
16. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
17. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
18. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
19. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
20. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
21. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
22. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
23. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
24. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
25. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
26. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
27. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
28. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
29. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
30. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
31. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
32. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
33. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
34. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
35. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
36. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
37. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
38. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
39. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
40. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
41. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
42. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
43. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
44.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
45. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.","1. 3

13. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
14. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
15. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
16. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
17. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
18. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
19. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
20. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
21. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
22. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
23. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
24. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
25. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
26. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
27. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
28. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
29. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
30. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
31. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
32. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
33. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
34. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
35. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
36. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
37. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
38. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
39. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
40. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
41. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
42. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
43.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
44. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
45. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
2. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
3. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
4. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
5. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
6. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
7. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
8. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
9. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
10. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
11. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
12. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
13. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
14. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
15. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
16.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
17. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
18. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
19. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
20. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
21. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
22. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
23. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
24. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
25. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
26. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
27. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
28. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
29. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
30. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
31. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
32. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
33. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
34. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
35. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
36. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
37. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
38. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
39. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
40. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
41. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
42. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
43. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
44. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.

## [Considerations]:
1. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
2. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
3. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
4. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
5. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
6. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
7. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
8. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
9. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
10. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
11. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
12. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
13. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
14. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
15. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
16. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
17. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
18.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
19. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
20. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
21. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
22. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
23. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
24. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
25. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
26. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
27. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
28. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
29. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
30. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
31. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
32. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
33. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
34. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
35. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
36. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
37. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
38. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
39. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
40. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
41. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
42. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
43. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
44. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
45. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.","1. 4

## [Considerations]:
1. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
2. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
3. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
4. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
5. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
6. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
7. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
8. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
9. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
10. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
11. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
12. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
13. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
14. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
15. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
16. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
17.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
18. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
19. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
20. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
21. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
22. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
23. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
24. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
25. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
26. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
27. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
28. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
29. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
30. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
31. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
32. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
33. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
34. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
35. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
36. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
37. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
38. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
39. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
40. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
41. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
42. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
43. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
44. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
45. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.
2. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
3. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
4. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process
5. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
6. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
7. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
8. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
9. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
10. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
11. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
12. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.
13. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
14. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
15. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
16. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
17. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
18. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
19. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
20. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
21. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
22. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
23. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
24. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
25. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
26. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
27. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
28. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.
29. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
30. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
31. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities
32. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
33. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
34. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
35. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
36. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.","1. 11

3. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
4. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
5. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process
6. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
7. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.

9. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
10. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
11. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
12. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
13. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
14. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
15. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
16. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
17. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
18. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion

21. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
22. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
23. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
24. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
25. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
26. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
27. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
28. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
29. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
30. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
31. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
32. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
33. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
34. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities
35. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.

## [Considerations]:
1. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
2. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
3. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
4. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
5. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
6. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
7. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
8. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
9. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
10. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
11. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
12. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
13. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
14. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
15. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
16. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
17. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
18. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
19. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
20. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
21. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
22. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
23. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
24. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
25. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
26. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
27. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
28. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
29. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
30. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
31. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
32. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
33. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
34. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
35. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. ","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
2. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
3. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
4. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
5. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
6. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
7. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
8. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
9. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
10. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
11. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
12. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
13. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
14. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
15. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
16. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
17. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
18. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
19. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
20. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
21. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
22. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
23. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
24. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
25. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
26. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
27. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
28. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
29. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
30. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
31. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
32. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
33. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.

## [Considerations]:
1. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
2. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
3. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
4. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
5. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
6. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
7. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
8. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
9. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
10. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
11. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
12. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
13. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
14. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
15. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
16. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
17. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
18. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
19. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
20. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
21. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
22. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
23. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
24. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
25. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
26. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
27. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
28. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
29. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
30. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
31. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
32. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
33. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
34. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
35. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
2. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
3. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
4. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
5. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
6. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
7. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
8. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
9. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
10. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
11. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
12. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
13. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
14. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
15. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
16. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
17. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
18. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
19. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
20. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
21. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
22. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
23. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
24. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
25. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
26. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
27. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
28. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
29. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
30. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
31. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
32. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
33. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
34. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.

1. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
2. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
3. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
4. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
5. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
6. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
7. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
8. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
9. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
10. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
11. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
12. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
13. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
14. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
15. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
16. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
17. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
18. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
19. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
20. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
21. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
22. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
23. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
24. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
25. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
26. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
27. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
28. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
29. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
30. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
31. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
32. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.

1. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
2. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
3. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.

5. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
6. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
7. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
8. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
9. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
10. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
11. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
12. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
13. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
14. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
15. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
16. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
17. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
18. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
19. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
20. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
21. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
22. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
23. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
24. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
25. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
26. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
27. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
28. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.

## [Considerations]:
1. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
2. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
3. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
4. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
5. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
6. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
7. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
8. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
9. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
10. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
11. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
12. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
13. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
14. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
15. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
16. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
17. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
18. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
19. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
20. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
21. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
22. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
23. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
24. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
25. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
26. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
27. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
28. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
29. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
30. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
31. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
32. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
33. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
34. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
35. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
36. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
37. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
38. Genome editing is really cool science.
39. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
40. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
41. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
42. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
43. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
44. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
45. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.","1. 5

26. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
27. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
28. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
29. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
30. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.

## [Considerations]:
1. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
2. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
3. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
4. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
5. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
6. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
7. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
8. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
9. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
10. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
11. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
12. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
13. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
14. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
15. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
16. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
17. Genome editing is really cool science.
18. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
19. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
20. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
21. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
22. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
23. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
24. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
25. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
26. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
27. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
28. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
29. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
30. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
31. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
32. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
33. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
34. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
35. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
36. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
37. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
38. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
39. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
40. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
41. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
42. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
43. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
44. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.

3. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
4. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
5. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
6. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
7. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
8. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
9. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.

12. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
13. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
14. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
15. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
16. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
17. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
18. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
19. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
20. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
21. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
22. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
23. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
24. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
25. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
26. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.

## [Considerations]:
1. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
2. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
3. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
4. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
5. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
6. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
7. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
8. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
9. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
10. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
11. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
12. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
13. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
14. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
15. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
16. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
17. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
18. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
19. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
20. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
21. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
22. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
23. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.

7. The function of the Fremantle Bridge as a transport gateway is more important than its heritage.
8. We should definitely preserve the heritage value of the bridge, but only if it is financially viable.
9. River craft deserve better traffic conditions on the Swan River.
10. There are no specific economic benefits for the Fremantle from the bridge.

26. Indigenous people would want to minimize impact on the Swan River, a registered site, that is of importance and significance to them.
27. We shouldn't stick to the past when deciding about the future of the bridge, we should be open for modern design options.
28. Since the traffic bridge has important heritage significance, the only grounds for its removal should be on the grounds of serious safety issues and verified by heritage engineers.
29. Replacing timber elements with steel components would destroy the authentic appearance of the bridge.
30. Reducing the risk of vessel collision on the Swan River should be the main consideration when deciding about the future of the bridge

## [Considerations]:
1. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
2. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
3. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
4. It is certain that climate change exists.
5. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
6. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
7. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
8. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
9. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
10. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
11. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
12. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
13. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
14. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
15. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
16. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
17. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
18. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
19. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
20. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
21. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
22. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
23. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
24. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
25. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
26. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
27. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
28. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
29. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
30. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
31. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
32. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
33. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.","1. 1

## [Policies]:
1. Policies that involve a dramatic cut back in CO2 emissions (at least 50% in the next 10 years).
2. Preparing for climate risk through the development of new approaches and technologies that enhance resilience to the impacts of climate variability or change.
3. Adaptation policies that target individual, small business or community-based actions (e.g., support the installation of alternative energy generators, insulation, water use efficiency)
4. Policies that involve a moderate cut in CO2 emissions (at least 25% in over the next 10 years).
5. Leave the policy settings as they are.
6. Adaptation policies and expenditure. Planning controls and emergency response programs.
7. Policies that emphasise economic growth over climate change adaptation or mitigation.","1. 1
