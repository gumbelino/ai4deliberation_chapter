## [Considerations]:
1. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
2. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
3. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
4. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
5. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
6. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
7. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
8. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
9. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
10. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
11. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
12. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
13. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
14. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
15. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
16. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
17. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
18. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
19. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
20. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
21. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
22. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
23. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
24. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
25. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
26. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
27. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
28. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
29. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
30. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
31. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
32. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
33. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
34. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
35. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
36. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
37. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
38. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
39. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
40. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
41. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
42. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
43. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. The road is just the 'thin edge of the wedge'. This may not happen for a long time, but it will happen.
2. Economic development associated with the Bloomfield Track will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
3. The coral reefs along the foreshore below the Bloomfield Track are not badly affected by the road.
4. Native animals in the Daintree need protection because they have a right to life which cannot be traded against economic considerations.
5. When it comes to the Bloomfield Track, it's not important to worry about what the future will hold
6. If we don't take steps to protect the Daintree Rainforest future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the area as we do now.
7. When it comes to the Bloomfield track, people living in Cairns are in no position to judge what the interests of the local residents of Bloomfield are.
8. Whilst impacts on locals in the Bloomfield area are a concern, it is the broader community that should carry more weight when deciding what to do with the Bloomfield Track.
9. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track does not cause siltation or damage to the fringing inshore reefs between Cape Tribulation and Cooktown
10. In deciding on what to do with the Bloomfield Track I don't know whether it's more important to meet the needs of the community or the environment.
11. I'm not sure if the future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by locals, outsiders or both.
12. No development should be permitted in World Heritage areas such as the Daintree.
13. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track is permanently damaging the coral reefs that fringe the beaches below
14. A long term perspective on the Bloomfield Track is essential.
15. Everyone in Queensland is better off for having a road like the Bloomfield Track.
16. I don't like how development is creeping further and further North into the Daintree and beyond because of its effect on the environment.
17. The Bloomfield Track is important because it allows quick access to remote areas of the North.
18. Using cars on the Bloomfield Track is bad for the rainforest.
19. If future generations could have their say about the Bloomfield track, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
20. I don't know what the people of Bloomfield think about the Bloomfield Track.
21. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Daintree region because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
22. The Bloomfield Track issue is important for Queensland.
23. I don't know if improving the Bloomfield Track would lead to a rapid acceleration of development in the area to the detriment of the environment.
24. The Bloomfield Track may not have been the best idea, but I guess there is probably little point in closing it now that it has been built.
25. Conservation in the Daintree area is worthwhile at whatever cost.
26. The fate of the Bloomfield Track is of no concern to me.
27. Any decision about the Bloomfield Track will greatly affect people like me.
28. The Wujal Wujal Community is better off now that the Bloomfield Track has been built.
29. I think that both short and long term perspectives are needed in deciding what should be done with the Bloomfield Track, but I don't know which one is more important.
30. The future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by everyone and not just by those who live in the Bloomfield area.
31. If the Bloomfield Track is sealed (bitumenized) there will not be a rapid increase in environmentally damaging development in the Daintree area in the future It may even benefit the environment there.
32. I would be worse off if more of the Daintree rainforest is protected.
33. I have no idea what the people in the Bloomfield area think about the Bloomfield Track.
34. There is no reason to believe that the Daintree Rainforest is under threat.
35. Laying bitumen on the Bloomfield Track would be beneficial for the environment
36. The more that it is possible for the average North Queensland resident can access the Bloomfield Track the better
37. I don't really know who benefits most from the protection of Rainforest in the Daintree.
38. Let's fix the problems in the Daintree just for now. The future will take care of itself.
39. The most important use of the Bloomfield Track is for tourism.
40. I don't know how, but I think that there must be some way in which everybody benefits from protecting the rainforest near the Bloomfield Track.
41. I'm concerned that I will be made worse off by any decision about the Bloomfield Track.
42. The protection of plants and animals in the Daintree is OK so long as it doesn't affect me.","1. 8

1. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
2. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
3. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
4. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
5. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
6. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
7. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
8. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
9. People get the government they deserve
10. I'm always cynical about government processes.
11. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
12. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
13. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
14. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
15. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
16. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
17. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
18. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
19. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
20. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
21. We live in a great democracy.
22. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
23. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
24. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
25. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
26. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
27. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
28. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
29. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
30. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
31. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
32. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
33. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
34. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
35. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
36. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
37. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
38. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
39. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
40. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
41. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
42. We are a democratic country.
43. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
44. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
45. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
46. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
47. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.

## [Considerations]:
1. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
2. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
3. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
4. We live in a great democracy.
5. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
6. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
7. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
8. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
9. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
10. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
11. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
12. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
13. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
14. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
15. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
16. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
17. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
18. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
19. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
20. I'm always cynical about government processes.
21. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
22. We are a democratic country.
23. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
24. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
25. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
26. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
27. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
28. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
29. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
30. People get the government they deserve
31. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
32. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
33. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
34. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
35. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
36. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
37. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
38. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
39. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
40. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
41. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
42. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
43. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
44. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
45. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
46. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
47. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.

## [Considerations]:
1. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
2. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
3. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
4. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
5. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
6. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
7. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
8. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
9. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
10. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
11. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
12. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
13. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
14. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
15. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
16. I'm always cynical about government processes.
17. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
18. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
19. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
20. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
21. People get the government they deserve
22. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
23. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
24. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
25. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
26. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
27. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
28. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
29. We are a democratic country.
30. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
31. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
32. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
33. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
34. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
35. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
36. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
37. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
38. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
39. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
40. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
41. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
42. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
43. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
44. We live in a great democracy.
45. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
46. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
47. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.

15. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
16. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
17. People get the government they deserve
18. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
19. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
20. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
21. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
22. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
23. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
24. We are a democratic country.
25. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
26. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
27. I'm always cynical about government processes.
28. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
29. We live in a great democracy.
30. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
31. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
32. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
33. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
34. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
35. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
36. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
37. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
38. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
39. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
40. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
41. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
42. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
43. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
44. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
45. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
46. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
47. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
48. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.","1. 8

1. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
2. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
3. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
4. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
5. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
6. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
7. We live in a great democracy.
8. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
9. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
10. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
11. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
12. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
13. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
14. We are a democratic country.
15. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
16. I'm always cynical about government processes.
17. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
18. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
19. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
20. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
21. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
22. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
23. People get the government they deserve
24. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
25. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
26. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
27. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?

34. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
35. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
36. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
37. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
38. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
39. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
40. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
41. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.

14. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
15. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.

17. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
18. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
19. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
2. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
3. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
4. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
5. I care about the planet.
6. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
7. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
8. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
9. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
10. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
11. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
12. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
13. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
14. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
15. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
16. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
17. We can adapt to the coming changes.
18. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
19. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
20. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
21. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
22. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
23. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
24. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
25. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
26. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
27. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
28. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
29. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
30. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
31. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
32. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
33. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
2. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
3. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
4. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
5. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
6. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
7. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
8. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
9. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
10. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
11. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
12. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
13. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
14. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
15. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
16. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
17. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
18. Forest health means jobs.
19. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
20. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
21. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
22. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
23. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
24. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
25. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
26. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.

3. Forest health means jobs.
4. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
5. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.

7. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
8. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
9. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
10. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
11. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
12. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
13. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
14. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
15. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
16. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
17. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
18. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
19. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
20. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
21. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
22. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
23. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
24. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
25. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
26. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
27. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
28. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
29. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
30. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
31. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
32. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
33. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
34. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
35. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
36. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
37. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management.

40. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
41. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.

## [Considerations]:
1. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
2. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
3. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
4. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
5. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
6. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
7. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
8. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
9. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
10. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
11. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
12. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
13. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
14. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
15. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
16. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
17. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
18. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
19. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
20. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
21. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
22. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
23. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
24. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
25. Forest health means jobs.
26. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
27. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
28. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
29. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
30. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
31. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
32. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
33. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
34. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
35. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
36. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
37. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
38. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
39. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
40. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
41. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
42. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
43. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
44. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
45. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.","1. 7

5. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
6. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
7. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.

13. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
14. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
15. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
16. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.

28. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
29. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
30. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
31. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.

38. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
39. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
40. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
41. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
42. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
43. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
44. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.

1. It is always permissible to do research on my personally identifiable sample without my prior permission.  
2. Participants who donate their samples for research should be given special access to the treatments and therapies that result from that research. 
3. Genetic information is different from health information. 
4. Participants should be contacted every time researchers want to use their samples for research.
5. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.  
6. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government. 
7. If someone is a carrier of a genetic disease, they have a responsibility to participate in genetic research.
8. Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.
9. There is no point in consulting the public about ethical issues in science and technology.
10. Aboriginal communities require special consideration concerning healthcare and research.
11. Policy makers should consider the possibility that Canada should not pursue biobanking.
12. There is no risk to the participants who donate to biobanks.
13. Participants should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at anytime. 
14. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies.
15. The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  
16. I trust researchers to control access to my personal samples.
17. Genetic research will improve our lives.
18. Educating people about health issues (e.g. diet and lifestyle changes) promises greater health effects than investing in biobanks.
19. I should have property rights to my tissues before or after they leave my body.
20. Biobanks need independent review boards to determine who should have access to samples. 
21. Scientists should have access to all unidentified, personal samples for research.
22. The priority for healthcare should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
23. Sampling some people in an ethnocultural community is acceptable only if the whole ethnocultural community has agreed to participate.
24. Everyone should donate samples to a biobank for the benefit of everyone. 
25. I do not care if my donated sample is connected to my name and medical information.
26. All participants should be paid for donating their samples to a biobank. 
27. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health.
28. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
29. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
30. Biobanks will only lead to expensive treatments and high profits. 
31. Researchers should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.  
32. Participants should be active in the set up and oversight of  biobanks. 
33. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for bothers me. 
34. Genetic studies of disability will lead to the discrimination of people living with the same conditions.
35. To me, religious communities need to be consulted about genetic and biobank research. 
36. Profits from biobanking should be returned to the donating community. 
37. Genetic studies of race on enthocultural communities will lead to the discrimination of those same enthocultural communities. 
38. My personal sample should never be anonymized since I should be informed of important research results.  ","1. 1

1. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
2. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
3. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
4. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
5. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
6. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
7. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
8. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
9. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
10. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
11. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
12. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
13. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
14. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
15. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
16. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
17. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
18. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.

3. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
4. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
5. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
6. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
7. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
8. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
9. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
10. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
11. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
12. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
13. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
14. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
15. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
16. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
17. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
18. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
19. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
20. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
21. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
22. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
23. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
24. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
25. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
26. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.

1. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
2. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
3. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
4. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
5. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
6. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
7. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
8. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
9. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
10. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
11. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
12. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
13. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
14. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
15. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
16. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
17. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
18. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
19. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
20. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
21. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
22. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
23. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
24. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
25. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
26. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
27. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
28. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
29. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.

3. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
4. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
5. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
6. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
7. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
8. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
9. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
10. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
11. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
12. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
13. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
14. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
15. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
16. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
17. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
18. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
19. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
20. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
21. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
22. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
23. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
24. Food waste is a major environmental issue

3. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
4. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
5. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
6. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
7. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
8. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
9. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
10. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
11. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
12. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
13. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
14. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
15. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
16. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
17. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
18. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
19. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
20. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
21. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.

17. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
18. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
19. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
20. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
21. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
22. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
23. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
24. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
25. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
26. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
27. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
28. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
29. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
30. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality","1. 4

## [Considerations]:
1. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
2. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
3. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
4. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
5. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
6. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
7. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
8. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
9. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
10. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
11. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
12. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
13. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
14. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
15. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
16. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
17. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
18. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
19. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
20. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
21. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
22. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
23. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
24. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
25. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
26. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
27. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
28. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
29. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
30. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.

4. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
5. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
6. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
7. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
8. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
9. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
10. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
11. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
12. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
13. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
14. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
15. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
16. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
17. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
18. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
19. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
20. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
21. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
22. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
23. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
24. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).

1. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
2. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
3. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
4. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
5. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
6. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
7. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
8. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
9. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
10. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
11. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
12. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
13. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
14. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
15. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
16. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
17. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
18. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
19. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
20. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
21. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
22. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
23. It is certain that climate change exists.
24. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
25. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
26. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
27. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
28. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
29. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
30. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
31. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
32. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
33. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.","1. 6

3. River craft deserve better traffic conditions on the Swan River.
4. This magnificent timber bridge is a rare and beautiful sight in today's world, it should be preserved. 
5. Any changes to the bridge should give right consideration to the environment.bridge
6. We just got traffic calming in Town Centre after 25 years effort. I don't want bridge to be build bigger, better faster to reverse the gains of the last 25 years.
7. Providing a better pedestrian and cycle traffic should be the main consideration when deciding about the future of the bridge.
8. The main concern is to have a bridge that underpins the economic activities in the region.
9. It is most important that the solution is a long term one.
10. The problem is not the vulnerable structure of the bridge but excessive traffic, which should be reduced.
11. Alterations will lead to nothing but the uglification of the bridge.
12. Altering or replacing the existing Fremantle Bridge means diminishing Fremantle.
13. Tax payers money should be spent on services that are more essential than upgrading the bridge.
14. The bridge is certainly an attractive entry statement to Fremantle and without doubt far more important than trucks.
15. The function of the Fremantle Bridge as a transport gateway is more important than its heritage.
16. Whatever works are undertaken, the heritage value of the old bridge will be affected.
17. The most important thing is that access to Fremantle from its north is maintained in the most undisturbed manner as possible. 
18. We should definitely preserve the heritage value of the bridge, but only if it is financially viable.
19. Replacing timber elements with steel components would destroy the authentic appearance of the bridge.
20. The existing bridge is too low; archways too narrow and do not line up with the railway bridge making navigation dangerous. 
21. The most important issue for cyclists is safety, which means they need access across the bridge which has a good surface.
22. When deciding about the future of the bridge, indigenous concerns should be given adequate consideration. 
23. Indigenous people would want to minimize impact on the Swan River, a registered site, that is of importance and significance to them.
24. We shouldn't stick to the past when deciding about the future of the bridge, we should be open for modern design options.
25. There are no specific economic benefits for the Fremantle from the bridge.
26. The critical infrastructure of the bridge raises serious safety concerns. 
27. The Fremantle Bridge is irreplaceable. It is a strong, enduring part of our history.
28. It is worth spending money to retain the iconic status of the bridge.
29. The old bridge will never be able to handle vehicles, bike and pedestrians at the same time.
30. The cost of maintaining the old timber structure is too high.
31. Safe and efficient movement of all road and river users across and under the bridge should the main considerations
32. The old bridge provides a scenic entrance to Fremantle that attracts tourists.
33. The Fremantle Traffic Bridge is the most iconic landmark and the main tourist attraction in Fremantle. 
34. The bridge has stood the test of time for the past 67 years; there's no need for major changes to it.
35. As long as there is a bridge that I can cross, I don't care about its structure.
36. Since the traffic bridge has important heritage significance, the only grounds for its removal should be on the grounds of serious safety issues and verified by heritage engineers.","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
2. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
3. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
4. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
5. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
6. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
7. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
8. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
9. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
10. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
11. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
12. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
13. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
14. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
15. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
16. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
17. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
18. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
19. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
20. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
2. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
3. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
4. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
5. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
6. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
7. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
8. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
9. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
10. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
11. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
12. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
13. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
14. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
15. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
16. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
17. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
18. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
19. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
20. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
21. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
22. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
23. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
24. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
25. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
26. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
27. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
28. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
29. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
30. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
31. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
32. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
33. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
34. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
35. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
36. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
37. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
38. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
39. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
40. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
41. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.

## [Considerations]:
1. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
2. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
3. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
4. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
5. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
6. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
7. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
8. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
9. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
10. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
11. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
12. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
13. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
14. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
15. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
16. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
17. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
18. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
19. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
20. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
21. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
22. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
23. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
24. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
25. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
26. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
27. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
28. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
29. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
30. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
31. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
32. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
33. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
34. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
35. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
36. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
37. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
38. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
39. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
40. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
41. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations

## [Considerations]:
1. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
2. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
3. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
4. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
5. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
6. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
7. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
8. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
9. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
10. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
11. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
12. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
13. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
14. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
15. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
16. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
17. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
18. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
19. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
20. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
21. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
22. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
23. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
24. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
25. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
26. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
27. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
28. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
29. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
30. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
31. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
32.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
33. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
34. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
35. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
36. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
37. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
38. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
39. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
40. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
41. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
42. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
43. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
44. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
45. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. ","1. 3

21. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
22. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
23. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
24. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
25. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
26. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
27. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
28. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
29. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
30. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
31. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
32. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
33. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
34. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
35. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
36. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
37. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
38. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
39. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
40. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
41. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
42. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
43. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
44. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
45. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.","1. 8

3. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
4. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
5. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
6. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
7. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
8. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
9. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
10. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
11. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
12. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.

14. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
15.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
16. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
17. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
18. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
19. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
20. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
21. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
22. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
23. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
24. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
25. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
26. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
27. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
28. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.

31. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
32. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
33. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
34. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
35. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
36. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
37. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
38. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
39. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
40. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
41. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
42. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.

## [Considerations]:
1. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
2. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
3. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
4. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
5. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
6. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
7. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
8. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
9. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
10. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
11. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
12. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
13. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
14. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
15. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
16. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
17. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
18. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
19. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
20. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
21. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
22. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
23. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
24. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
25. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
26. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
27. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
28. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
29. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
30. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
31. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
32. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
33. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
34. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
35. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
36. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
37. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
38. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
39. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
40. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
41. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
42. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
43.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
44. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
45. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.","1. 9

1. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
2. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
3. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
4. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
5. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
6. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
7. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
8. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
9. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities
10. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
11. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
12. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
13. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
14. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
15. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
16. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
17. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
18. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
19. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
20. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
21. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
22. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.
23. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.
24. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
25. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
26. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
27. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
28. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
29. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
30. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
31. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
32. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
33. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
34. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
35. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process

1. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
2. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
3. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
4. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
5. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
6. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
7. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
8. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
9. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
10. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
11. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
12. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
13. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
14. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
15. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
16. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
17. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
18. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
19. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
20. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
21. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
22. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
23. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
24. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
25. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
26. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
27. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
28. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
29. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
30. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
31. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
32. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
33. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
34. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.

## [Considerations]:
1. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
2. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
3. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
4. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
5. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
6. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
7. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
8. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
9. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
10. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
11. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
12. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
13. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
14. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
15. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
16. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
17. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
18. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
19. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
20. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
21. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
22. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
23. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
24. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
25. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
26. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
27. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
28. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
29. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.

## [Considerations]:
1. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
2. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
3. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
4. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
5. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
6. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
7. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
8. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
9. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
10. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
11. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
12. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
13. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
14. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
15. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
16. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
17. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
18. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
19. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
20. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
21. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
22. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
23. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
24. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
25. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
26. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
27. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
28. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
29. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
30. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
31. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
32. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
33. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
34. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.

3. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
4. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
5. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
6. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
7. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
8. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
9. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
10. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
11. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
12. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
13. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
14. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
15. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
16. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
17. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
18. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
19. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
20. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
21. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
22. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
23. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
24. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
25. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
26. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
27. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
28. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
29. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
30. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
31. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
32. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
33. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
34. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.

## [Considerations]:
1. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
2. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
3. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
4. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
5. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
6. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
7. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
8. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
9. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
10. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
11. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
12. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
13. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
14. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
15. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
16. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
17. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
18. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
19. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
20. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
21. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
22. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
23. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
24. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
25. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
26. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
27. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
28. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
29. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
30. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
31. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
32. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
33. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
34. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
35. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
36. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
37. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
38. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
39. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
40. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
41. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
42. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
43. Genome editing is really cool science.
44. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.

## [Considerations]:
1. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
2. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
3. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
4. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
5. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
6. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
7. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
8. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
9. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
10. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
11. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
12. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
13. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
14. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
15. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
16. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
17. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
18. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
19. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
20. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
21. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
22. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
23. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
24. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.","1. 6

5. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
6. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
7. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
8. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
9. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
10. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
11. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
12. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.

16. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
17. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
18. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
19. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.

## [Considerations]:
1. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
2. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
3. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
4. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
5. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
6. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
7. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
8. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
9. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
10. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
11. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
12. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
13. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
14. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
15. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
16. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
17. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
18. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
19. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
20. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.

1. Genetic research will improve our lives.
2. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
3. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
4. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
5. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
6. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
7. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
8. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
9. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
10. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
11. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
12. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
13. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
14. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
15. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
16. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
17. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
18. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
19. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
20. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
21. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
22. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
23. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
24. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
25. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
26. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
27. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
28. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
29. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
30. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
31. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
32. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
33. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
34. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
35. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
36. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.

13. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
14. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
15. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
16. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
17. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
18. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.

25. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
26. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
27. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
28. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
29. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.

9. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
10. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
11. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
12. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.

19. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
20. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
21. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
22. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
23. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
24. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
25. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
26. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.

## [Considerations]:
1. The Bloomfield Track is important because it allows quick access to remote areas of the North.
2. Whilst impacts on locals in the Bloomfield area are a concern, it is the broader community that should carry more weight when deciding what to do with the Bloomfield Track.
3. When it comes to the Bloomfield track, people living in Cairns are in no position to judge what the interests of the local residents of Bloomfield are.
4. If future generations could have their say about the Bloomfield track, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
5. Using cars on the Bloomfield Track is bad for the rainforest.
6. The fate of the Bloomfield Track is of no concern to me.
7. I think that both short and long term perspectives are needed in deciding what should be done with the Bloomfield Track, but I don't know which one is more important.
8. When it comes to the Bloomfield Track, it's not important to worry about what the future will hold
9. The Bloomfield Track may not have been the best idea, but I guess there is probably little point in closing it now that it has been built.
10. The future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by everyone and not just by those who live in the Bloomfield area.
11. Conservation in the Daintree area is worthwhile at whatever cost.
12. The road is just the 'thin edge of the wedge'. This may not happen for a long time, but it will happen.
13. I don't know what the people of Bloomfield think about the Bloomfield Track.
14. The Bloomfield Track issue is important for Queensland.
15. There is no reason to believe that the Daintree Rainforest is under threat.
16. The more that it is possible for the average North Queensland resident can access the Bloomfield Track the better
17. I don't know if improving the Bloomfield Track would lead to a rapid acceleration of development in the area to the detriment of the environment.
18. No development should be permitted in World Heritage areas such as the Daintree.
19. I have no idea what the people in the Bloomfield area think about the Bloomfield Track.
20. I would be worse off if more of the Daintree rainforest is protected.
21. The protection of plants and animals in the Daintree is OK so long as it doesn't affect me.
22. The Wujal Wujal Community is better off now that the Bloomfield Track has been built.
23. The coral reefs along the foreshore below the Bloomfield Track are not badly affected by the road.
24. I don't know how, but I think that there must be some way in which everybody benefits from protecting the rainforest near the Bloomfield Track.
25. I don't really know who benefits most from the protection of Rainforest in the Daintree.
26. Laying bitumen on the Bloomfield Track would be beneficial for the environment
27. Economic development associated with the Bloomfield Track will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
28. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track does not cause siltation or damage to the fringing inshore reefs between Cape Tribulation and Cooktown
29. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Daintree region because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
30. I'm not sure if the future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by locals, outsiders or both.
31. A long term perspective on the Bloomfield Track is essential.
32. The most important use of the Bloomfield Track is for tourism.

## [Considerations]:
1. The more that it is possible for the average North Queensland resident can access the Bloomfield Track the better
2. Whilst impacts on locals in the Bloomfield area are a concern, it is the broader community that should carry more weight when deciding what to do with the Bloomfield Track.
3. I think that both short and long term perspectives are needed in deciding what should be done with the Bloomfield Track, but I don't know which one is more important.
4. There is no reason to believe that the Daintree Rainforest is under threat.
5. The protection of plants and animals in the Daintree is OK so long as it doesn't affect me.
6. The Bloomfield Track is important because it allows quick access to remote areas of the North.
7. When it comes to the Bloomfield track, people living in Cairns are in no position to judge what the interests of the local residents of Bloomfield are.
8. The most important use of the Bloomfield Track is for tourism.
9. I don't like how development is creeping further and further North into the Daintree and beyond because of its effect on the environment.
10. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track is permanently damaging the coral reefs that fringe the beaches below
11. The fate of the Bloomfield Track is of no concern to me.
12. Any decision about the Bloomfield Track will greatly affect people like me.
13. If the Bloomfield Track is sealed (bitumenized) there will not be a rapid increase in environmentally damaging development in the Daintree area in the future It may even benefit the environment there.
14. I don't know how, but I think that there must be some way in which everybody benefits from protecting the rainforest near the Bloomfield Track.
15. Laying bitumen on the Bloomfield Track would be beneficial for the environment
16. The future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by everyone and not just by those who live in the Bloomfield area.
17. No development should be permitted in World Heritage areas such as the Daintree.
18. I don't know what the people of Bloomfield think about the Bloomfield Track.
19. The road is just the 'thin edge of the wedge'. This may not happen for a long time, but it will happen.
20. Using cars on the Bloomfield Track is bad for the rainforest.
21. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track does not cause siltation or damage to the fringing inshore reefs between Cape Tribulation and Cooktown
22. The coral reefs along the foreshore below the Bloomfield Track are not badly affected by the road.
23. I don't know if improving the Bloomfield Track would lead to a rapid acceleration of development in the area to the detriment of the environment.
24. I would be worse off if more of the Daintree rainforest is protected.
25. In deciding on what to do with the Bloomfield Track I don't know whether it's more important to meet the needs of the community or the environment.
26. If future generations could have their say about the Bloomfield track, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
27. I'm concerned that I will be made worse off by any decision about the Bloomfield Track.
28. Conservation in the Daintree area is worthwhile at whatever cost.
29. Let's fix the problems in the Daintree just for now. The future will take care of itself.
30. I have no idea what the people in the Bloomfield area think about the Bloomfield Track.
31. When it comes to the Bloomfield Track, it's not important to worry about what the future will hold
32. Economic development associated with the Bloomfield Track will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
33. The Bloomfield Track may not have been the best idea, but I guess there is probably little point in closing it now that it has been built.
34. If we don't take steps to protect the Daintree Rainforest future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the area as we do now.
35. The Wujal Wujal Community is better off now that the Bloomfield Track has been built.
36. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Daintree region because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
37. A long term perspective on the Bloomfield Track is essential.
38. Everyone in Queensland is better off for having a road like the Bloomfield Track.

## [Considerations]:
1. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
2. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
3. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
4. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
5. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
6. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
7. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
8. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
9. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
10. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
11. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
12. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
13. People get the government they deserve
14. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
15. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
16. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
17. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
18. We are a democratic country.
19. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
20. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
21. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
22. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
23. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
24. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
25. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
26. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
27. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
28. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
29. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
30. I'm always cynical about government processes.
31. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
32. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
33. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
34. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
35. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
36. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
37. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
38. We live in a great democracy.
39. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
40. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
41. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
42. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
43. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
44. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
45. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
46. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
47. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
48. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.","1. 8

15. We live in a great democracy.
16. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.

21. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
22. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
23. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.

35. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
36. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
37. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
38. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.

## [Considerations]:
1. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
2. People get the government they deserve
3. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
4. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
5. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
6. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
7. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
8. I'm always cynical about government processes.
9. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
10. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
11. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
12. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
13. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
14. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
15. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
16. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
17. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
18. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
19. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
20. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
21. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
22. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
23. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
24. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
25. We are a democratic country.
26. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
27. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
28. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
29. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
30. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
31. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
32. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
33. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
34. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
35. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
36. We live in a great democracy.
37. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
38. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
39. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
40. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
41. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
42. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
43. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
44. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
45. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
46. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
47. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
48. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
2. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
3. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
4. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
5. We are a democratic country.
6. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
7. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
8. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
9. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
10. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
11. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
12. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
13. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
14. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
15. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
16. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
17. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
18. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
19. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
20. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
21. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
22. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
23. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
24. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
25. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
26. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
27. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
28. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
29. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
30. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
31. We live in a great democracy.
32. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
33. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
34. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
35. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
36. People get the government they deserve
37. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
38. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
39. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
40. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
41. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
42. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
43. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
44. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
45. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
46. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
47. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
48. I'm always cynical about government processes.","1. 8

3. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
4. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
5. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
6. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
7. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
8. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
9. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
10. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
11. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
12. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
13. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
14. We are a democratic country.
15. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
16. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
17. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
18. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
19. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
20. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
21. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
22. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
23. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
24. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
25. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
26. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
27. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
28. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
29. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
30. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
31. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
32. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
33. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
34. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
35. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
36. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
37. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
38. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
39. We live in a great democracy.
40. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
41. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
42. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
43. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
44. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
45. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
46. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
47. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.

26. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
27. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
28. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
29. I'm always cynical about government processes.
30. People get the government they deserve
31. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
32. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
33. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
34. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
35. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
36. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
37. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
38. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
39. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
40. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
41. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
42. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
43. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
44. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
45. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
46. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
47. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
48. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
2. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
3. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
4. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
5. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
6. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
7. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
8. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
9. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
10. People get the government they deserve
11. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
12. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
13. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
14. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
15. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
16. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
17. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
18. I'm always cynical about government processes.
19. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
20. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
21. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
22. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
23. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
24. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
25. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
26. We are a democratic country.
27. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
28. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
29. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
30. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
31. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
32. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
33. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
34. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
35. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
36. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
37. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
38. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
39. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
40. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
41. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
42. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
43. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
44. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
45. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
46. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
47. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.

14. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
15. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
16. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
17. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
18. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
19. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
20. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.

22. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.

1. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
2. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
3. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
4. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
5. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
6. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
7. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
8. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
9. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
10. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
11. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
12. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
13. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
14. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
15. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
16. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
17. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
18. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
19. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
20. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
21. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
22. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
23. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
24. I care about the planet.
25. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
26. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
27. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
28. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
29. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
30. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
31. We can adapt to the coming changes.
32. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
33. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.","1. 3

1. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
2. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
3. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
4. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
5. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
6. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
7. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
8. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
9. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
10. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
11. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
12. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
13. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
14. I care about the planet.
15. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
16. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
17. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
18. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
19. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
20. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
21. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
22. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
23. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
24. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
25. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
26. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
27. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
28. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.

## [Considerations]:
1. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
2. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
3. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
4. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
5. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
6. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
7. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
8. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
9. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
10. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
11. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
12. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
13. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
14. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
15. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
16. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
17. We can adapt to the coming changes.
18. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
19. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
20. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
21. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
22. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
23. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
24. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
25. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
26. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
27. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
28. I care about the planet.
29. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
30. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
31. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
32. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
33. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.","1. 9

13. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
14. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
15. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
16. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
17. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
18. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
19. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
20. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
21. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
22. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
23. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
24. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
25. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
26. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
27. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
28. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
29. I care about the planet.
30. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
31. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
32. We can adapt to the coming changes.
33. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.","1. 11

## [Considerations]:
1. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
2. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
3. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
4. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
5. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
6. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
7. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
8. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
9. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
10. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
11. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
12. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
13. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
14. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
15. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
16. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
17. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
18. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
19. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
20. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
21. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
22. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
23. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
24. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
25. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
26. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
27. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
28. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
29. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
30. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
31. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
32. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
33. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
34. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
35. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
36. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
37. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
38. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
39. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
40. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
41. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
42. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
43. Forest health means jobs.
44. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
45. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
2. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
3. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
4. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
5. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
6. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
7. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
8. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
9. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
10. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
11. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
12. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
13. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
14. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
15. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
16. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
17. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
18. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
19. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
20. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
21. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
22. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
23. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
24. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
25. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
26. Forest health means jobs.
27. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
28. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
29. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
30. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
31. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
32. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
33. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
34. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
35. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
36. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
37. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
38. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
39. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
40. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
41. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
42. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
43. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
44. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
45. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. ","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
2. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
3. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
4. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
5. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
6. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
7. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
8. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
9. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
10. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
11. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
12. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
13. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
14. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
15. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
16. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
17. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
18. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
19. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
20. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
21. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
22. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
23. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
24. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
25. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
26. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
27. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
28. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
29. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
30. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
31. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
32. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
33. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
34. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
35. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
36. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
37. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
38. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
39. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
40. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
41. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
42. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
43. Forest health means jobs.
44. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.

## [Considerations]:
1. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
2. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
3. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
4. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
5. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
6. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
7. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
8. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
9. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
10. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
11. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
12. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
13. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
14. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
15. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
16. Forest health means jobs.
17. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
18. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
19. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
20. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
21. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
22. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
23. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
24. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
25. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
26. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
27. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
28. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
29. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
30. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
31. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
32. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
33. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
34. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
35. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
36. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
37. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
38. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
39. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
40. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
41. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
42. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
43. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
44. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
45. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.","1. 9

17. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
18. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
19. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
20. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
21. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
22. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.

1. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
2. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
3. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
4. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
5. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
6. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
7. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
8. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
9. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
10. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
11. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
12. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
13. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
14. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
15. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
16. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
17. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
18. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
19. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
20. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
21. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
22. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
23. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
24. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
25. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
26. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
27. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
28. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
29. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
30. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.

4. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
5. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
6. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
7. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
8. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
9. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
10. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
11. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
12. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
13. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
14. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
15. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
16. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
17. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
18. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
19. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
20. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
21. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
22. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
23. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
24. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
25. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
26. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
27. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
28. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
29. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.

1. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
2. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
3. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
4. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
5. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
6. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
7. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
8. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
9. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
10. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
11. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
12. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
13. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
14. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
15. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
16. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
17. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
18. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
19. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
20. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
21. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
22. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
23. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
24. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
25. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
26. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
27. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
28. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
29. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.

1. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
2. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
3. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
4. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
5. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
6. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
7. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
8. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
9. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
10. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
11. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
12. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
13. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
14. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
15. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
16. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
17. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
18. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
19. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
20. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
21. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
22. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
23. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
24. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
25. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
26. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
27. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
28. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
29. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.

## [Considerations]:
1. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
2. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
3. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
4. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
5. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
6. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
7. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
8. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
9. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
10. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
11. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
12. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
13. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
14. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
15. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
16. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
17. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
18. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
19. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
20. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
21. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
22. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
23. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
24. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
25. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
26. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
27. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
28. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
29. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.

## [Considerations]:
1. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
2. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
3. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
4. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
5. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
6. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
7. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
8. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
9. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
10. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
11. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
12. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
13. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
14. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
15. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
16. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
17. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
18. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
19. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
20. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
21. Food waste is a major environmental issue
22. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
23. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
24. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
25. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
26. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
27. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
28. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
29. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices

## [Considerations]:
1. Food waste is a major environmental issue
2. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
3. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
4. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
5. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
6. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
7. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
8. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
9. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
10. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
11. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
12. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
13. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
14. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
15. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
16. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
17. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
18. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
19. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
20. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
21. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
22. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
23. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
24. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
25. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
26. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
27. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
28. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
29. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
30. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
2. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
3. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
4. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
5. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
6. Food waste is a major environmental issue
7. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
8. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
9. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
10. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
11. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
12. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
13. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
14. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
15. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
16. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
17. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
18. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
19. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
20. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
21. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
22. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
23. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
24. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
25. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
26. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
27. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
28. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
29. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy

2. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
3. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
4. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
5. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
6. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
7. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
8. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
9. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
10. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
11. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
12. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
13. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
14. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
15. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
16. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
17. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
18. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
19. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
20. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
21. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
22. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
23. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
24. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
25. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
26. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
27. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
28. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
29. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
30. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
31. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.

1. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
2. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
3. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
4. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
5. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
6. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
7. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
8. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
9. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
10. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
11. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
12. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
13. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
14. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
15. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
16. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
17. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
18. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
19. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
20. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
21. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
22. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
23. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
24. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
25. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
26. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
27. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
28. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
29. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
30. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.

1. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
2. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
3. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
4. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
5. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
6. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
7. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
8. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
9. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
10. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
11. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
12. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
13. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
14. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
15. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
16. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
17. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
18. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
19. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
20. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
21. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
22. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
23. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
24. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
25. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
26. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
27. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
28. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
29. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
30. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.

1. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
2. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
3. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
4. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
5. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
6. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
7. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
8. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
9. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
10. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
11. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
12. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
13. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
14. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
15. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
16. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
17. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
18. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
19. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
20. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
21. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
22. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
23. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
24. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
25. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
26. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
27. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
28. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
29. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
30. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.

17. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
18. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
19. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.

## [Considerations]:
1. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
2. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
3. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
4. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
5. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
6. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
7. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
8. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
9. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
10. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
11. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
12. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
13. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
14. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
15. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
16. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
17. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
18. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
19. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
20. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
21. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
22. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
23. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
24. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
25. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
26. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
27. It is certain that climate change exists.
28. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
29. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
30. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
31. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
32. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.

1. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
2. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
3. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
4. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
5. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
6. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
7. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
8. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
9. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
10. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.

3. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
4. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
5. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”

## [Considerations]:
1. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
2. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
3. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
4. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
5. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
6. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
7. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
8. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
9. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
10. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
11. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
12. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
13. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
14. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
15. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
16. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
17. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
18. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
19. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
20. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
21. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
22. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
23. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
24. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
25. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
26. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
27. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
28. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
29. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
30. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
31. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
32. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
33. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
34. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
35. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
36. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
37. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
38. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
39. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
40. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
41. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.

## [Considerations]:
1. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
2. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
3. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
4. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
5. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
6. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
7. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
8. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
9. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
10. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
11. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
12. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
13. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
14. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
15. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
16. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
17. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
18. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
19. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
20. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
21. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
22. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
23. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
24. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
25. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
26. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
27. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
28. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
29. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
30. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
31. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
32. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
33. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
34. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
35. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
36. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
37. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
38. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
39. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
40. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
41. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
42. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
43. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
2. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
3. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
4. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
5. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
6. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
7. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
8. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
9. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
10. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
11. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
12. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
13. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
14. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
15. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
16. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
17. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
18. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
19. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
20. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
21. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
22. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
23. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
24. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
25. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
26. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
27. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
28. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
29. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
30. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
31. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
32. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
33. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
34. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
35. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
36. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
37. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
38. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
39. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
40. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
41. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
42. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.

37. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
38. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
39. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.

## [Considerations]:
1.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
2. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
3. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
4. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
5. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
6. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
7. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
8. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
9. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
10. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
11. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
12. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
13. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
14. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
15. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
16. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
17. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
18. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
19. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
20. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
21. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
22. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
23. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
24. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
25. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
26. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
27. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
28. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
29. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
30. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
31. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
32. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
33. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
34. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
35. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
36. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
37. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
38. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
39. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
40. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
41. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
42. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
43. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
44. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
45. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
2. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
3. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
4. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
5. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
6. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
7. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
8. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
9. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
10. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
11. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
12. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
13. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
14. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
15. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
16. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
17. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
18. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
19. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
20. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
21. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
22. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
23. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
24. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
25. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
26. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
27. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
28. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
29. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
30. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
31. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
32. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
33. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
34. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
35. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
36. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
37. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
38. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
39. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
40.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
41. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
42. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
43. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
44. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
45. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
2. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
3. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
4. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
5. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
6. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
7. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
8. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
9. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
10. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
11. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
12. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
13. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
14. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
15. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
16. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
17. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
18. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
19. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
20. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
21. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
22. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
23. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
24. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
25. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
26. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
27. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
28.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
29. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
30. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
31. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
32. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
33. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
34. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
35. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
36. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
37. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
38. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
39. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
40. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
41. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
42. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
43. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
44. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
45. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.","1. 3

35. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
36. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
37. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
38. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.

40. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
41. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
42. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
43. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
44. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.

## [Considerations]:
1. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
2. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
3. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
4. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
5. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
6. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
7. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
8. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
9. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
10. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
11. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
12. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
13. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
14. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
15. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
16. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
17. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
18. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
19. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
20. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
21. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
22. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
23. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
24. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
25. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
26. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
27.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
28. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
29. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
30. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
31. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
32. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
33. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
34. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
35. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
36. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
37. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
38. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
39. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
40. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
41. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
42. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
43. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
44. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.

## [Considerations]:
1. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
2. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
3. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
4. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
5. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
6. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
7. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
8. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
9. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
10. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
11. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
12. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
13. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
14. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
15. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
16. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
17. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
18. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
19. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
20. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
21. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
22. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
23. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
24. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
25. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
26. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
27. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
28. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
29. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
30. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
31. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
32. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
33. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
34. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
35. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
36.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
37. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
38. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
39. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
40. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
41. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
42. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
43. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
44. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
45. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.","1. 9

7. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
8. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
9. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
10. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
11. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
12. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
13. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
14. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
15. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
16. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
17. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
18. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
19. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
20. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
21. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
22. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
23. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
24. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
25. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
26. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
27. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
28. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
29. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
30. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
31. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
32. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
33. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
34. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
35. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
36. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
37. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
38. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
39. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
40. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
41.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
42. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
43. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
44. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.

40. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
41. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
42. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
43. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
44. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
45. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
2. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
3. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
4. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
5. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
6. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
7. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
8. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
9. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
10. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
11. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
12. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
13. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
14. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
15. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
16. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
17. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
18. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
19. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
20. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
21. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
22. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
23. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
24. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
25. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
26. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
27. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
28. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
29. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
30. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
31. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
32. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
33. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
34. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
35. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
36. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
37. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
38. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
39. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
40. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
41. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
42.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
43. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
44. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
45. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.","1. 7

1. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
2. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
3. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
4. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
5. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process
6. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.
7. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
8. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
9. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
10. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
11. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
12. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
13. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
14. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
15. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.
16. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.
17. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
18. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
19. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
20. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
21. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
22. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
23. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
24. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities
25. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
26. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
27. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
28. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
29. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
30. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
31. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
32. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
33. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
34. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
35. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
36. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.","1. 5

3. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
4. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
5. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
6. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
7. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
8. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
9. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
10. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
11. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
12. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
13. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
14. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
15. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
16. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
17. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
18. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
19. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
20. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
21. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
22. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
23. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
24. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
25. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
26. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
27. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
28. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
29. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
30. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
31. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment.

## [Considerations]:
1. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
2. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
3. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
4. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
5. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
6. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
7. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
8. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
9. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
10. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
11. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
12. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
13. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
14. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
15. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
16. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
17. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
18. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
19. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
20. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
21. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
22. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
23. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
24. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
25. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
26. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
27. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
28. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
29. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
30. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
31. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
32. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
33. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
34. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.

## [Considerations]:
1. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
2. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
3. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
4. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
5. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
6. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
7. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
8. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
9. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
10. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
11. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
12. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
13. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
14. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
15. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
16. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
17. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
18. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
19. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
20. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
21. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
22. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
23. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
24. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
25. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
26. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
27. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
28. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
29. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change

## [Considerations]:
1. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
2. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
3. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
4. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
5. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
6. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
7. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
8. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
9. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
10. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
11. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
12. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
13. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
14. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
15. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
16. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
17. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
18. Genetic research will improve our lives.
19. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
20. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
21. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
22. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
23. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
24. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
25. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
26. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
27. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
28. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
29. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
30. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
31. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
32. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
33. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
34. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
35. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
36. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
37. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
38. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
39. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
40. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
41. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
42. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
43. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
44. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
45. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
46. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
47. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
48. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
49. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.","1. 9

1. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
2. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
3. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
4. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
5. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
6. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
7. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
8. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
9. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
10. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
11. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
12. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
13. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
14. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
15. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
16. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
17. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
18. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
19. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
20. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
21. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
22. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
23. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
24. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
25. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
26. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
27. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
28. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
29. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
30. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
31. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
32. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
33. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
34. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
35. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
36. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
37. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
38. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
39. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
40. Genetic research will improve our lives.
41. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
42. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
43. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
44. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
45. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
46. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
47. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
48. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.

## [Considerations]:
1. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
2. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
3. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
4. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
5. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
6. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
7. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
8. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
9. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
10. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
11. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
12. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
13. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
14. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
15. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
16. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
17. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
18. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
19. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
20. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
21. Genetic research will improve our lives.
22. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
23. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
24. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
25. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
26. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
27. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
28. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
29. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
30. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
31. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
32. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
33. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
34. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
35. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
36. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
37. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
38. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
39. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
40. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
41. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
42. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
43. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
44. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
45. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
46. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
47. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
48. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.

2. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
3. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
4. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
5. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
6. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
7. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
8. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
9. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
10. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
11. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
12. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
13. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
14. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
15. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
16. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
17. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
18. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
19. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
20. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
21. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
22. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
23. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
24. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
25. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
26. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
27. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
28. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
29. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
30. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
31. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
32. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
33. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
34. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
35. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
36. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
37. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
38. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
39. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
40. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
41. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
42. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
43. Genetic research will improve our lives.
44. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
45. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
46. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
47. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
48. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.

3. Cautious Implementation: Minimal input of public resources to development biobanking Use resources  — use instead for other approaches to improving health. Very strict oversight of use of biobanks and strong privacy provisions.
4. High Privacy: Implementation of a (publicy or privately owned) biobanking system where privacy of individuals is paramount. Stored data and biological samples for research requires the authorization of individual donors.
5. Privately Funded with minimal regulation: Minimal regulation of privately run biobanking system with maximum participation of the public. Low privacy provisions.

1. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
2. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
3. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
4. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
5. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
6. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
7. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
8. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
9. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
10. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
11. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
12. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
13. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
14. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
15. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
16. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
17. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
18. Genome editing is really cool science.
19. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
20. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
21. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
22. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
23. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
24. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
25. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
26. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
27. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
28. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
29. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
30. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
31. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
32. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
33. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
34. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
35. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
36. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
37. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
38. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
39. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
40. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
41. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.

1. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
2. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
3. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
4. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
5. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
6. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
7. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
8. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
9. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
10. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
11. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
12. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
13. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
14. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
15. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
16. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
17. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
18. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
19. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
20. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
21. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
22. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
23. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
24. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
25. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
26. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
27. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
28. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
29. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
30. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
31. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
32. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
33. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
34. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
35. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
36. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
37. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
38. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
39. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
40. Genome editing is really cool science.
41. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
42. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
43. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
44. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
45. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. ","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
2. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
3. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
4. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
5. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
6. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
7. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
8. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
9. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
10. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
11. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
12. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
13. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
14. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
15. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
16. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
17. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
18. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
19. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
20. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
21. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
22. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
23. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
24. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
25. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
26. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
27. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
28. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
29. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
30. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
31. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
32. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
33. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
34. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
35. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
36. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
37. Genome editing is really cool science.
38. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
39. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
40. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
41. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
42. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
43. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
44. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.

1. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
2. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
3. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
4. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
5. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
6. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
7. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
8. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
9. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
10. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
11. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
12. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
13. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
14. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
15. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
16. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
17. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
18. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
19. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
20. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
21. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
22. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
23. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
24. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
25. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
26. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
27. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
28. Genome editing is really cool science.
29. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
30. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
31. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
32. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
33. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
34. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
35. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
36. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
37. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
38. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
39. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
40. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
41. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
42. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
43. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
44. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.

## [Considerations]:
1. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
2. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
3. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
4. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
5. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
6. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
7. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
8. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
9. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
10. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
11. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
12. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
13. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
14. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
15. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
16. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
17. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
18. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
19. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
20. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
21. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
22. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
23. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
24. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
2. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
3. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
4. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
5. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
6. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
7. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
8. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
9. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
10. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
11. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
12. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
13. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
14. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
15. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
16. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
17. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
18. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
19. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
20. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
21. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
22. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
23. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
24. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
2. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
3. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
4. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
5. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
6. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
7. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
8. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
9. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
10. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
11. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
12. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
13. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
14. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
15. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
16. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
17. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
18. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
19. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
20. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
21. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
22. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
23. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
24. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
2. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
3. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
4. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
5. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
6. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
7. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
8. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
9. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
10. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
11. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
12. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
13. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
14. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
15. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
16. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
17. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
18. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
19. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
20. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
21. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
22. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
23. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
24. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
2. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
3. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
4. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
5. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
6. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
7. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
8. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
9. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
10. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
11. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
12. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
13. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
14. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
15. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
16. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
17. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
18. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
19. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
20. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
21. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
22. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
23. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
24. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
2. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
3. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
4. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
5. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
6. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
7. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
8. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
9. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
10. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
11. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
12. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
13. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
14. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
15. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
16. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
17. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
18. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
19. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
20. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
21. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
22. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
23. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
24. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
25. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
26. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
27. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
28. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
29. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
30. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
31. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
32. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
33. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
34. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
35. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. ","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
2. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
3. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
4. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
5. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
6. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
7. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
8. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
9. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
10. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
11. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
12. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
13. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
14. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
15. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
16. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
17. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
18. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
19. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
20. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
21. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
22. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
23. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
24. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
25. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
26. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
27. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
28. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
29. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
30. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
31. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
32. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
33. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
34. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.

## [Considerations]:
1. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
2. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
3. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
4. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
5. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
6. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
7. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
8. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
9. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
10. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
11. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
12. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
13. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
14. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
15. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
16. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
17. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
18. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
19. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
20. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
21. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
22. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
23. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
24. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
25. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
26. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
27. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
28. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
29. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
30. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
31. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
32. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
33. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
34. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
35. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.","1. 2
