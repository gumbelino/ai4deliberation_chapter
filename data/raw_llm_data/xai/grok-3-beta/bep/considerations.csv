Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.,C3. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.,C4. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.,C5. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.,C6. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.,C7. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.,C8. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.,C9. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.,C10. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.,"C11. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.","C12. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.",C13. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.,C14. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products,"C15. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it","C16. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.",C17. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.,C18. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”,C19. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries,C20. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations,C21. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.,C22. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”,C23. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.,"C24. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable",C25. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.,C26. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy,C27. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track,C28. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”,C29. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”,"C30. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. ","C31. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.",C32. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.,C33. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.,C34. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.,"C35. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.","C36. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.","C37. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.",C38. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature,C39. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.,"C40. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. ",C41. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics,C42. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.,C43. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change.
