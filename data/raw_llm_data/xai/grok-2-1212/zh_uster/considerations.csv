I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.,C4. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.,C5. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.,C6. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.,C7. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.,"C8. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.",C9. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.,"C10. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.",C11. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.,C12. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.,C13. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.,C14. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.,C15. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.,C16. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).,C17. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.,C18. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.,C19. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.,C20. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.,C21. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.,"C22. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. ",C23. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.,C24. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.,"C25. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.",C26. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.,"C27. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. ",C28. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.,"C29. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. ",C30. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.,"C31. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. "
