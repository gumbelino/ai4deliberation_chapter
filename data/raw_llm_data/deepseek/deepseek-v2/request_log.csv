## [Considerations]:
1. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
2. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
3. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
4. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
5. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
6. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
7. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
8. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
9. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
10. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
11. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
12. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
13. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
14. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
15. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
16. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
17. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
18. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
19. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
20. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
21. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
22. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
23. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
24. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
25. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
26. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
27. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
28. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
29. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
30. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
31. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
32. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
33. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
34. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
35. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
36. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
37. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
38. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
39. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
40. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
41. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
42. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
43. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”"," 7

26. I don't like how development is creeping further and further North into the Daintree and beyond because of its effect on the environment.
27. I don't know how, but I think that there must be some way in which everybody benefits from protecting the rainforest near the Bloomfield Track.
28. If we don't take steps to protect the Daintree Rainforest future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the area as we do now.
29. If future generations could have their say about the Bloomfield track, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
30. The protection of plants and animals in the Daintree is OK so long as it doesn't affect me.
31. I don't really know who benefits most from the protection of Rainforest in the Daintree.

## [Considerations]:
1. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
2. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
3. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
4. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
5. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
6. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
7. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
8. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
9. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
10. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
11. People get the government they deserve
12. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
13. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
14. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
15. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
16. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
17. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
18. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
19. I'm always cynical about government processes.
20. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
21. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
22. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
23. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
24. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
25. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
26. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
27. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
28. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
29. We live in a great democracy.
30. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
31. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
32. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
33. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
34. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
35. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
36. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
37. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
38. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
39. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
40. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
41. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
42. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
43. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
44. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
45. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
46. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
47. We are a democratic country.
48. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around."," 10

1. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
2. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
3. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
4. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
5. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
6. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
7. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
8. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
9. We can adapt to the coming changes.
10. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
11. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
12. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
13. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
14. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
15. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
16. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
17. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
18. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
19. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
20. I care about the planet.
21. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
22. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
23. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
24. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
25. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
26. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
27. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
28. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
29. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
30. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
31. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.

12. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
13. We can adapt to the coming changes.
14. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
15. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
16. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
17. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
18. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
19. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
20. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
21. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
22. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
23. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
24. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
25. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
26. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
27. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
28. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
29. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
30. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
31. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
32. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
33. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard."," 10

## [Considerations]:
1. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
2. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
3. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
4. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
5. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
6. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
7. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
8. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
9. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
10. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
11. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
12. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
13. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
14. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
15. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
16. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
17. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
18. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
19. Forest health means jobs.
20. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
21. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
22. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
23. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
24. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
25. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
26. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
27. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
28. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
29. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
30. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
31. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
32. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
33. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
34. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
35. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
36. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
37. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
38. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
39. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
40. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
41. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
42. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
43. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
44. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
45. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration."," 10

## [Considerations]:
1. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
2. Food waste is a major environmental issue
3. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
4. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
5. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
6. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
7. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
8. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
9. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
10. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
11. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
12. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
13. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
14. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
15. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
16. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
17. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
18. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
19. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
20. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
21. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
22. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
23. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
24. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
25. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
26. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
27. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
28. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
29. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality

1. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
2. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
3. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
4. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
5. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
6. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
7. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
8. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
9. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
10. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
11. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
12. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
13. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
14. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
15. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
16. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
17. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
18. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
19. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
20. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
21. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
22. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
23. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
24. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
25. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
26. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
27. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
28. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
29. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
30. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
31. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.

5. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
6. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
7. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
8. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
9. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
10. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
11. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
12. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
13. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
14. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
15. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
16. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
17. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
18. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
19. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
20. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
21. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
22. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
23. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
24. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
25. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
26. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
27. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
28. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
29. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
30. It is certain that climate change exists.
31. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).

## [Considerations]:
1. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
2. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
3. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
4. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
5. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
6. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
7. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
8. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
9. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
10. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
11. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
12. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
13. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
14. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
15. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
16. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
17. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
18. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
19. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
20. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes."," 1. 7

7. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
8. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
9. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
10. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
11. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
12. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
13. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
14. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
15. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
16. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
17. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
18. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
19. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
20. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children."," 1. 7

3. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
4. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
5. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
6. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
2. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
3. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
4. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
5. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
6. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
7. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
8.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
9. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
10. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
11. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
12. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
13. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
14. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
15. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
16. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
17. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
18. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
19. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
20. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
21. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
22. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
23. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
24. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
25. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
26. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
27. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
28. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
29. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
30. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
31. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
32. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
33. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
34. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
35. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
36. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
37. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
38. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
39. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
40. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
41. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
42. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
43. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
44. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
45. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen."," 10

14. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
15. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
16. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
17.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
18. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
19. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
20. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
21. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
22. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
23. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
24. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
25. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
26. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
27. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
28. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
29. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
30. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
31. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
32. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
33. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
34. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
35. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
36. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
37. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
38. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
39. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
40. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
41. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
42. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
43. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
44. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
45. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have."," 10

3. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
4. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
5. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
6. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
7. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
8. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
9. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
10. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
11. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
12. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
13. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
14. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
15. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
16. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
17. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
18. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
19. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
20. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
21. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
22. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
23. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
24. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
25. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
26. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
27. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
28. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
29. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
30. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
31. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
32. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
33. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
34. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.

1. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
2. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
3. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
4. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
5. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
6. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
7. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
8. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
9. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
10. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
11. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.

## [Considerations]:
1. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
2. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
3. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
4. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
5. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
6. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
7. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
8. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
9. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
10. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
11. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
12. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
13. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
14. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
15. Genetic research will improve our lives.
16. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
17. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
18. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
19. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
20. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
21. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
22. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
23. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
24. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
25. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
26. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
27. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
28. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
29. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
30. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
31. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
32. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
33. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
34. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
35. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
36. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
37. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
38. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
39. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
40. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
41. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
42. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
43. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
44. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
45. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
46. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
