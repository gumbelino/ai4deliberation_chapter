Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.,C2. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. ,C3. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.,C4. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.,C5. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. ,"C6. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions â€” more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.",C7. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.,C8. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.,"C9. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.",C10. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. ,C11. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. ,C12. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.,C13. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.,"C14. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.",C15. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.,C16. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.,C17. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. ,"C18. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.","C19. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.",C20. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.,C21. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.,C22. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.,C23. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. ,C24. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. ,"C25. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.","C26. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.",C27. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.,C28. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.,C29. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. ,C30. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.,C31. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.,"C32. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.","C33. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.",C34. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. ,"C35. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.","C36. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. ","C37. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.",C38. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. ,C39. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.,C40. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.,"C41. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.",C42. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.,C43. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.,C44. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.,C45. Forest health means jobs.
