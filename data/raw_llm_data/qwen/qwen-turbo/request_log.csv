## [Considerations]:
1. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
2. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
3. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
4. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
5. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
6. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
7. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
8. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
9. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
10. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
11. People get the government they deserve
12. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
13. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
14. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
15. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
16. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
17. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
18. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
19. I'm always cynical about government processes.
20. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
21. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
22. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
23. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
24. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
25. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
26. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
27. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
28. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
29. We live in a great democracy.
30. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
31. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
32. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
33. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
34. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
35. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
36. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
37. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
38. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
39. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
40. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
41. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
42. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
43. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
44. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
45. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
46. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
47. We are a democratic country.
48. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.","1. 8

1. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.

4. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
5. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
6. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
7. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
8. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
9. We can adapt to the coming changes.
10. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
11. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
12. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
13. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
14. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
15. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
16. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
17. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
18. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
19. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
20. I care about the planet.
21. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.

23. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
24. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.

## [Considerations]:
1. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
2. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
3. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
4. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
5. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
6. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
7. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
8. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
9. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
10. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
11. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
12. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
13. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
14. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
15. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
16. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
17. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
18. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
19. Forest health means jobs.
20. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
21. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
22. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
23. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
24. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
25. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
26. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
27. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
28. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
29. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
30. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
31. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
32. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
33. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
34. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
35. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
36. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
37. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
38. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
39. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
40. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
41. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
42. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
43. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
44. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat.

20. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
21. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
22. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
23. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.

25. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
26. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
27. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
28. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
29. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.

2. Food waste is a major environmental issue
3. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
4. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
5. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
6. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
7. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
8. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
9. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
10. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
11. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
12. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
13. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
14. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
15. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
16. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
17. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
18. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
19. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
20. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
21. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
22. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
23. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
24. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
25. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy

## [Considerations]:
1. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
2. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
3. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
4. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
5. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
6. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
7. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
8. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
9. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
10. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
11. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
12. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
13. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
14. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
15. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
16. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
17. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
18. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
19. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
20. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
2. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
3. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
4. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
5. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
6. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
7. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
8. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
9. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
10. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
11. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
12. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
13. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
14. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
15. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
16. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
17. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
18. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
19. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
20. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
21. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
22. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
23. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
24. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
25. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
26. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
27. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
28. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
29. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
30. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
31. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
32. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
33. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
34. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
35. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
36. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
37. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
38. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
39. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
40. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
41. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
42. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
43. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.","1. 7

5. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
6. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
7. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
8.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
9. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
10. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
11. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
12. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
13. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
14. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
15. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
16. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
17. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
18. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
19. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
20. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
21. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
22. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
23. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
24. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
25. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
26. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
27. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
28. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
29. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
30. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
31. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
32. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
33. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
34. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
35. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
36. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
37. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
38. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
39. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
40. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
41. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
42. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
43. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
44. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
45. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
2. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
3. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
4. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
5. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
6. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
7. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
8. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
9. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
10. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
11. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
12. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
13. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
14. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
15. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
16. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
17. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
18. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
19. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
20. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
21. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
22. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
23. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
24. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
25. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
26. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
27. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
28. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
29. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
30. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
31. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
32. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
33. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
34. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
35. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
2. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
3. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
4. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
5. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
6. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
7. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
8. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
9. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
10. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
11. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
12. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
13. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
14. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
15. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
16. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
17. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
18. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
19. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
20. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
21. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
22. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.

1. I'm not sure if the future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by locals, outsiders or both.
2. Economic development associated with the Bloomfield Track will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
3. The road is just the 'thin edge of the wedge'. This may not happen for a long time, but it will happen.
4. I'm concerned that I will be made worse off by any decision about the Bloomfield Track.
5. If future generations could have their say about the Bloomfield track, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
6. A long term perspective on the Bloomfield Track is essential.
7. When it comes to the Bloomfield track, people living in Cairns are in no position to judge what the interests of the local residents of Bloomfield are.

## [Considerations]:
1. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
2. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
3. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
4. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
5. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
6. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
7. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
8. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
9. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
10. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
11. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
12. We are a democratic country.
13. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
14. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
15. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
16. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
17. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
18. People get the government they deserve
19. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
20. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
21. I'm always cynical about government processes.
22. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
23. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
24. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
25. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
26. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
27. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
28. We live in a great democracy.
29. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
30. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
31. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
32. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
33. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
34. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
35. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
36. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
37. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
38. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
39. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
40. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
41. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
42. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
43. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
44. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
45. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
46. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
47. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
48. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.","1. 7

42. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.

## [Considerations]:
1. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
2. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
3. I'm always cynical about government processes.
4. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
5. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
6. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
7. We live in a great democracy.
8. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
9. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
10. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
11. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
12. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
13. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
14. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
15. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
16. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
17. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
18. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
19. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
20. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
21. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
22. People get the government they deserve
23. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
24. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
25. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
26. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
27. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
28. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
29. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
30. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
31. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
32. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
33. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
34. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
35. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
36. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
37. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
38. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
39. We are a democratic country.
40. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
41. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
42. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
43. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
44. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
45. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
46. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
47. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.

## [Considerations]:
1. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
2. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
3. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
4. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
5. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
6. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
7. People get the government they deserve
8. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
9. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
10. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
11. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
12. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
13. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
14. We are a democratic country.
15. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
16. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
17. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
18. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
19. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
20. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
21. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
22. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
23. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
24. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
25. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
26. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
27. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
28. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
29. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
30. We live in a great democracy.
31. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
32. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
33. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
34. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
35. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
36. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
37. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
38. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
39. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
40. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
41. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
42. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
43. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
44. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
45. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
46. I'm always cynical about government processes.
47. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
48. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.","1. 8

5. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
6. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
7. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
8. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
9. People get the government they deserve
10. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
11. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
12. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
13. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
14. I'm always cynical about government processes.
15. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
16. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
17. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
18. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
19. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
20. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
21. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
22. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
23. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
24. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
25. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
26. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
27. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
28. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
29. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
30. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
31. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
32. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
33. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
34. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
35. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
36. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
37. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
38. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
39. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
40. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
41. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
42. We live in a great democracy.
43. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
44. We are a democratic country.
45. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
46. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
47. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
48. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.","1. 2

1. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
2. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
3. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
4. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
5. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
6. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
7. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
8. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
9. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
10. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
11. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
12. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
13. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
14. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
15. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
16. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
17. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
18. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
19. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
20. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
21. I'm always cynical about government processes.
22. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
23. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
24. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
25. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
26. We live in a great democracy.
27. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
28. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
29. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
30. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
31. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
32. We are a democratic country.
33. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
34. People get the government they deserve
35. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
36. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
37. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
38. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
39. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
40. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
41. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
42. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
43. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
44. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
45. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
46. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.

## [Considerations]:
1. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
2. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
3. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
4. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
5. People get the government they deserve
6. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
7. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
8. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
9. We live in a great democracy.
10. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
11. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
12. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
13. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
14. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
15. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
16. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
17. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
18. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
19. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
20. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
21. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
22. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
23. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
24. I'm always cynical about government processes.
25. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
26. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
27. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
28. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
29. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
30. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
31. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
32. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
33. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
34. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
35. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
36. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
37. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
38. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
39. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
40. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
41. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
42. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
43. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
44. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
45. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
46. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.

## [Considerations]:
1. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
2. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
3. People get the government they deserve
4. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
5. I'm always cynical about government processes.
6. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
7. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
8. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
9. We are a democratic country.
10. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
11. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
12. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
13. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
14. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
15. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
16. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
17. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
18. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
19. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
20. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
21. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
22. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
23. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
24. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
25. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
26. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
27. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
28. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
29. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
30. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
31. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
32. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
33. We live in a great democracy.
34. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
35. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
36. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
37. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
38. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
39. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
40. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
41. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
42. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
43. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
44. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
45. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
46. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
47. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
48. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?","1. 11

10. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
11. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
12. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
13. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
14. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
15. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
16. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
17. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
18. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
19. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
20. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
21. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
22. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
23. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.

## [Considerations]:
1. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
2. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
3. We can adapt to the coming changes.
4. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
5. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
6. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
7. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
8. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
9. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
10. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
11. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
12. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
13. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
14. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
15. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
16. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
17. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
18. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
19. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
20. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
21. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
22. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
23. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
24. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
25. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
26. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
27. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
28. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
29. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
30. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
31. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
32. I care about the planet.

1. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
2. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
3. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
4. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
5. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
6. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
7. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
8. I care about the planet.
9. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
10. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
11. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
12. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
13. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
14. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
15. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
16. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
17. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
18. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
19. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
20. We can adapt to the coming changes.
21. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
22. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
23. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
24. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
25. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
26. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
27. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
28. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
29. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
30. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
31. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
32. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
33. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.","1. 2

1. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
2. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
3. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
4. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
5. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
6. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
7. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
8. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
9. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
10. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
11. We can adapt to the coming changes.
12. I care about the planet.
13. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
14. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
15. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
16. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
17. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
18. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
19. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
20. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
21. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
22. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
23. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
24. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
25. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
26. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
27. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
28. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
29. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
30. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.

## [Considerations]:
1. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
2. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
3. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
4. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
5. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
6. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
7. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
8. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
9. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
10. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
11. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
12. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
13. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
14. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
15. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
16. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
17. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
18. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
19. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
20. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
21. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
22. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
23. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
24. Forest health means jobs.
25. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
26. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
27. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
28. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
29. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
30. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
31. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
32. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
33. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
34. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
35. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
36. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
37. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
38. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
39. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
40. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
41. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
42. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.

## [Considerations]:
1. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
2. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
3. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
4. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
5. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
6. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
7. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
8. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
9. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
10. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
11. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
12. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
13. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
14. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
15. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
16. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
17. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
18. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
19. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
20. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
21. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
22. Forest health means jobs.
23. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
24. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
25. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
26. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
27. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
28. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
29. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
30. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
31. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
32. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
33. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
34. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
35. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
36. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
37. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
38. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
39. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
40. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
41. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
42. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
43. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
44. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
45. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
2. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
3. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
4. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
5. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
6. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
7. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
8. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
9. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
10. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
11. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
12. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
13. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
14. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
15. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
16. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
17. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
18. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
19. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
20. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
21. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
22. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
23. Forest health means jobs.
24. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
25. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
26. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
27. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
28. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
29. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
30. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
31. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
32. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
33. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
34. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
35. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
36. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
37. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
38. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
39. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
40. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
41. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
42. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
43. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
44. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
45. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.","1. 2

1. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
2. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
3. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
4. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
5. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
6. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
7. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
8. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
9. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
10. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
11. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
12. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
13. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
14. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
15. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
16. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
17. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
18. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
19. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
20. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
21. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
22. Forest health means jobs.
23. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
24. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
25. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
26. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
27. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
28. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
29. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
30. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
31. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
32. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
33. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
34. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
35. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
36. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
37. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
38. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
39. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
40. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
41. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
42. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
43. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
44. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.

1. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
2. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
3. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
4. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
5. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
6. Forest health means jobs.
7. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
8. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
9. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
10. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
11. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
12. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
13. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
14. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
15. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
16. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
17. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
18. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
19. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
20. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
21. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
22. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
23. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
24. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
25. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
26. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
27. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
28. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
29. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
30. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
31. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
32. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
33. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
34. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
35. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
36. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
37. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
38. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
39. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
40. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
41. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
42. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
43. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
44. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
45. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.","1. 8

2. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
3. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
4. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
5. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
6. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
7. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
8. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
9. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
10. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
11. Forest health means jobs.
12. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
13. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
14. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
15. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
16. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
17. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
18. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
19. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
20. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
21. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
22. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
23. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
24. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
25. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
26. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
27. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
28. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
29. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
30. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
31. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
32. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
33. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
34. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
35. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
36. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
37. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
38. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
39. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.

41. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
42. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
43. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.

## [Considerations]:
1. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
2. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
3. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
4. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
5. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
6. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
7. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
8. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
9. Forest health means jobs.
10. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
11. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
12. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
13. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
14. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
15. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
16. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
17. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
18. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
19. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
20. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
21. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
22. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
23. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
24. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
25. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
26. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
27. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
28. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
29. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
30. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
31. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
32. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
33. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
34. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
35. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
36. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
37. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
38. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
39. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
40. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
41. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
42. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
43. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
44. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
45. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. ","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. Participants should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at anytime. 
2. It is always permissible to do research on my personally identifiable sample without my prior permission.  
3. Educating people about health issues (e.g. diet and lifestyle changes) promises greater health effects than investing in biobanks.
4. Participants should be active in the set up and oversight of  biobanks. 
5. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies.
6. The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  
7. Biobanks will only lead to expensive treatments and high profits. 
8. I do not care if my donated sample is connected to my name and medical information.
9. Sampling some people in an ethnocultural community is acceptable only if the whole ethnocultural community has agreed to participate.
10. I should have property rights to my tissues before or after they leave my body.
11. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for bothers me. 
12. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
13. Genetic research will improve our lives.
14. There is no point in consulting the public about ethical issues in science and technology.
15. If someone is a carrier of a genetic disease, they have a responsibility to participate in genetic research.
16. All participants should be paid for donating their samples to a biobank. 
17. Scientists should have access to all unidentified, personal samples for research.
18. My personal sample should never be anonymized since I should be informed of important research results.  
19. There is no risk to the participants who donate to biobanks.
20. Everyone should donate samples to a biobank for the benefit of everyone. 
21. Genetic studies of disability will lead to the discrimination of people living with the same conditions.
22. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government. 
23. Researchers should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.  
24. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.  
25. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health.
26. To me, religious communities need to be consulted about genetic and biobank research. 
27. Aboriginal communities require special consideration concerning healthcare and research.
28. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
29. Policy makers should consider the possibility that Canada should not pursue biobanking.
30. Genetic studies of race on enthocultural communities will lead to the discrimination of those same enthocultural communities. 
31. Genetic information is different from health information. 
32. Participants who donate their samples for research should be given special access to the treatments and therapies that result from that research. 
33. I trust researchers to control access to my personal samples.
34. Profits from biobanking should be returned to the donating community. 
35. Biobanks need independent review boards to determine who should have access to samples. 
36. Participants should be contacted every time researchers want to use their samples for research.
37. The priority for healthcare should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
38. Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.","1. 11

3. Use of stored data and biological samples for research requires authorization from individuals ONLY when the individual is identifiable.
4. Regardless of privacy and oversight, it is most important to prevent discrimination (e.g., through insurance, social attitudes) that might result from research on collections of data and biological samples.
5. Use of stored data and biological samples for research requires authorization from individuals only when they are identifiable AND approval by an appropriate governing body (e.g. research ethics board) when they are not identifiable.

1. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
2. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
3. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
4. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
5. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
6. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
7. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
8. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.

14. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
15. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
16. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
17. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
18. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
19. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
20. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
21. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
22. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
23. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
24. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
25. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
26. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
27. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
28. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
29. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue.

## [Considerations]:
1. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
2. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
3. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
4. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
5. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
6. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
7. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
8. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
9. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
10. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
11. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
12. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
13. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
14. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
15. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
16. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
17. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
18. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
19. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
20. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
21. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
22. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
23. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
24. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
25. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
26. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
27. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
28. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
29. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.

1. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
2. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
3. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
4. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
5. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
6. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
7. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
8. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
9. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
10. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
11. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
12. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
13. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
14. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
15. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
16. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
17. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
18. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
19. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
20. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
21. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
22. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
23. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
24. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
25. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
26. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
27. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
28. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
29. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
30. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.

2. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
3. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
4. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
5. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
6. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
7. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
8. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
9. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
10. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
11. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
12. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
13. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
14. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
15. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
16. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
17. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
18. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
19. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
20. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
21. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
22. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
23. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
24. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
25. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
26. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
27. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
28. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
29. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
30. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
31. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).","1. 5

1. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
2. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
3. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
4. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
5. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
6. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
7. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
8. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
9. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
10. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
11. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
12. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
13. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
14. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
15. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
16. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
17. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
18. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
19. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
20. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
21. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).

4. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
5. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
6. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
7. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
8. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
9. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
10. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
11. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
12. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
13. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
14. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
15. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
16. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
17. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
18. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
19. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
20. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
21. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
22. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
23. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
24. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
25. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
26. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.

## [Considerations]:
1. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
2. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
3. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
4. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
5. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
6. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
7. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
8. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
9. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
10. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
11. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
12. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
13. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
14. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
15. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
16. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
17. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
18. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
19. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
20. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
21. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
22. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
23. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
24. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
25. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
26. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
27. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
28. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
29. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.

7. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
8. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
9. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
10. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.

16. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
17. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
18. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
19. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
20. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).

## [Considerations]:
1. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
2. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
3. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
4. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
5. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
6. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
7. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
8. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
9. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
10. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
11. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
12. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
13. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
14. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
15. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
16. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
17. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
18. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
19. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
20. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
21. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
22. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
23. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
24. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
25. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
26. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
27. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
28. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
29. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
30. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
31. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.","1. 6

12. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
13. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
14. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
15. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
16. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
17. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
18. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
19. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
20. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
21. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
22. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
23. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
24. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
25. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
26. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
27. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
28. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
29. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
30. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
31. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Food waste is a major environmental issue
2. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
3. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
4. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
5. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
6. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
7. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
8. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
9. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
10. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
11. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
12. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
13. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
14. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
15. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
16. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
17. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
18. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
19. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
20. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
21. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
22. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
23. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
24. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
25. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
26. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
27. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
28. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
29. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them

## [Considerations]:
1. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
2. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
3. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
4. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
5. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
6. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
7. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
8. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
9. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
10. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
11. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
12. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
13. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
14. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
15. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
16. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
17. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
18. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
19. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
20. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
21. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
22. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
23. Food waste is a major environmental issue
24. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
25. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
26. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
27. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
28. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
29. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.

## [Considerations]:
1. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
2. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
3. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
4. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
5. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
6. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
7. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
8. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
9. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
10. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
11. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
12. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
13. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
14. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
15. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
16. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
17. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
18. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
19. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
20. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
21. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
22. Food waste is a major environmental issue
23. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
24. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
25. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
26. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
27. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
28. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
29. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.

1. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
2. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
3. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
4. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
5. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
6. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
7. Food waste is a major environmental issue
8. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
9. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
10. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
11. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
12. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
13. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
14. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
15. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
16. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
17. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
18. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
19. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
20. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
21. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)

23. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
24. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy

12. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
13. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
14. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
15. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
16. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
17. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
18. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
19. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
20. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
21. Food waste is a major environmental issue
22. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
23. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
24. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
25. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
26. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
27. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
28. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
29. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.

14. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
15. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
16. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
17. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
18. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
19. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
20. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.

9. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
10. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
11. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
12. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
13. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
14. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
15. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
16. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
17. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
18. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
19. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.

1. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
2. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
3. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
4. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
5. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
6. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
7. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
8. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
9. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
10. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
11. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
12. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
13. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
14. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
15. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
16. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
17. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
18. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
19. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
20. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
21. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
22. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
23. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
24. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
25. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
26. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
27. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
28. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
29. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
30. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.

## [Considerations]:
1. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
2. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
3. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
4. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
5. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
6. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
7. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
8. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
9. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
10. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
11. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
12. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
13. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
14. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
15. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
16. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
17. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
18. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
19. It is certain that climate change exists.
20. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
21. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
22. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
23. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
24. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
25. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
26. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
27. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
28. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
29. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
30. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
31. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.

2. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
3. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
4. It is certain that climate change exists.
5. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
6. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
7. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
8. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
9. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
10. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
11. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
12. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
13. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
14. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
15. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
16. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
17. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
18. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
19. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
20. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
21. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
22. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
23. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
24. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
25. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
26. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
27. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
28. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
29. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
30. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
31. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
32. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
33. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.","1. 7

6. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
7. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
8. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
9. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
10. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
11. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
12. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
13. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
14. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
15. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
16. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
17. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
18. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
19. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
20. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
21. It is certain that climate change exists.
22. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
23. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
24. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
25. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
26. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
27. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
28. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
29. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.

6. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
7. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
8. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
9. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
10. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
11. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
12. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
13. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.

15. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
16. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
17. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
18. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
19. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
20. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.

1. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
2. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
3. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
4. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
5. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
6. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
7. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
8. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
9. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
10. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
11. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
12. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
13. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
14. It is certain that climate change exists.
15. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
16. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
17. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
18. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
19. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
20. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
21. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
22. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
23. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
24. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
25. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
26. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
27. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
28. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
29. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
30. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
31. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
32. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
33. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.","1. 1

## [Considerations]:
1. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
2. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
3. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
4. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
5. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
6. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
7. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
8. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
9. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
10. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
11. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
12. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
13. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
14. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
15. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
16. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
17. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
18. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
19. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
20. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
21. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
22. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
23. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
24. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
25. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
26. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
27. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
28. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
29. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
30. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
31. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
32. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
33. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
34. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
35. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
36. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
37. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
38. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
39. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
40. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
41. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
42. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
43. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
2. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
3. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
4. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
5. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
6. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
7. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
8. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
9. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
10. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
11. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
12. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
13. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
14. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
15. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
16. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
17. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
18. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
19. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
20. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
21. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
22. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
23. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
24. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
25. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
26. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
27. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
28. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
29. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
30. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
31. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
32. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
33. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
34. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
35. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
36. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
37. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
38. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
39. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
40. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
41. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
42. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
43. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
2. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
3. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
4. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
5. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
6. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
7. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
8. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
9. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
10. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
11. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
12. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
13. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
14. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
15. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
16. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
17. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
18. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
19. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
20. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
21. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
22. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
23. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
24. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
25. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
26. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
27. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
28. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
29. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
30. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
31. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
32. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
33. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
34. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
35. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
36. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
37. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
38. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
39. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
40. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
41. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
42. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.

## [Considerations]:
1. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
2. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
3. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
4. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
5. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
6. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
7. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
8. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
9. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
10. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
11. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
12. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
13. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
14. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
15. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
16. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
17. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
18. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
19. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
20. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
21. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
22. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
23. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
24. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
25. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
26. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
27. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
28. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
29. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
30. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
31. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
32. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
33. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
34. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
35. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
36. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
37. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
38. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
39. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
40. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
41. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
42. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
43. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
2. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
3. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
4. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
5. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
6. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
7. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
8. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
9. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
10. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
11. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
12. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
13. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
14. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
15. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
16. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
17. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
18. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
19. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
20. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
21. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
22. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
23. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
24. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
25. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
26. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
27. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
28. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
29. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
30. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
31. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
32. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
33. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
34. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
35. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
36. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
37. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
38. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
39. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
40. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
41. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
42. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
43. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.","1. 5

2. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
3. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
4. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
5. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
6. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
7. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
8. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
9. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
10. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
11. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
12. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
13. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
14. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
15. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
16. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
17. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
18. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
19. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
20. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
21. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
22. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
23. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
24. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
25. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
26. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
27. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
28. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
29. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
30. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
31. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
32. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
33. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
34. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
35. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
36. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
37. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
38. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
39. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
40. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.

15. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
16. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics

22. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
23. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track

26. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
27. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
28. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.

## [Considerations]:
1. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
2. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
3. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
4. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
5.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
6. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
7. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
8. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
9. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
10. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
11. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
12. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
13. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
14. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
15. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
16. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
17. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
18. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
19. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
20. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
21. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
22. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
23. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
24. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
25. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
26. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
27. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
28. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
29. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
30. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
31. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
32. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
33. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
34. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
35. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
36. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
37. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
38. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
39. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
40. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
41. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
42. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
43. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
44. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
45. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
2. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
3. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
4. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
5. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
6. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
7. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
8. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
9. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
10. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
11. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
12. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
13. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
14. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
15. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
16. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
17. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
18. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
19. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
20. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
21. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
22. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
23. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
24. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
25. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
26. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
27. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
28. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
29. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
30. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
31. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
32. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
33. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
34. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
35. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
36. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
37. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
38. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
39. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
40. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
41. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
42.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
43. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
44. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
45. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
2. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
3. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
4. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
5. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
6. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
7. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
8. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
9. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
10. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
11. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
12. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
13. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
14. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
15. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
16. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
17. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
18. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
19. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
20. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
21. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
22. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
23. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
24. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
25. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
26. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
27. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
28. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
29. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
30. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
31. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
32. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
33. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
34. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
35. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
36.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
37. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
38. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
39. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
40. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
41. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
42. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
43. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
44. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
45. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
2. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
3. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
4. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
5. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
6. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
7. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
8. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
9. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
10. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
11. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
12. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
13. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
14. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
15. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
16. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
17. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
18. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
19. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
20. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
21. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
22. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
23. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
24. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
25. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
26. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
27. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
28. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
29.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
30. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
31. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
32. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
33. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
34. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
35. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
36. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
37. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.

## [Considerations]:
1. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
2. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
3. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
4. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
5. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
6. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
7. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
8. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
9. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
10. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
11. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
12. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
13. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
14. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
15. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
16. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
17. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
18. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
19. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
20. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
21. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
22. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
23. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
24. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
25. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
26. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
27. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
28. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
29. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
30. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
31. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
32. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
33. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
34. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
35. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
36. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
37. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
38. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
39. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
40. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
41. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
42.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
43. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
44. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
45. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.","1. 2

4. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
5. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
6. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
7. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
8. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
9. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
10. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
11. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
12. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
13. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
14. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
15. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
16. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
17. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
18. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
19. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
20. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
21.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
22. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
23. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
24. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
25. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
26. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
27. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
28. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
29. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
30. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
31. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
32. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
33. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
34. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
35. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
36. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
37. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
38. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
39. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
40. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
41. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
42. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
43. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
44. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.

## [Considerations]:
1. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
2. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
3. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
4. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
5. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
6. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
7. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
8. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
9. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
10. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
11. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
12. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
13. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
14. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
15. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
16. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
17. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
18. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
19. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
20. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
21. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
22.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
23. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
24. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
25. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
26. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
27. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
28. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
29. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
30. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
31. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
32. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
33. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
34. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
35. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
36. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
37. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
38. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
39. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
40. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
41. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
42. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
43. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
44. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
45. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
2. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
3. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
4. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
5. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
6.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
7. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
8. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
9. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
10. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
11. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
12. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
13. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
14. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
15. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
16. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
17. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
18. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
19. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
20. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
21. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
22. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
23. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
24. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
25. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
26. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
27. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
28. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
29. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
30. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
31. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
32. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
33. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
34. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
35. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
36. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
37. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
38. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
39. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
40. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
41. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
42. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
43. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
44. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
45. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.","1. 10

17. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
18. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
19. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
20. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
21. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
22. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
23. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
24. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
25. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
26. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
27. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
28. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
29. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
30. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
31. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
32. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
33. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
34. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
35. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
36. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
37. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
38. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
39. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
40. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
41. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
42. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
43. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
44. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
45. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
2. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
3. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
4. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
5. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
6. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
7. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
8. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
9. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
10. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
11. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process
12. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
13. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
14. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
15. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities
16. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
17. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
18. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
19. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
20. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
21. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
22. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.
23. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
24. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
25. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.
26. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
27. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
28. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
29. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.
30. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
31. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
32. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
33. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
34. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
35. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
36. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services","1. 5

2. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
3. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
4. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
5. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
6. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
7. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
8. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need

12. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.
13. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
14. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
15. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.

## [Considerations]:
1. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
2. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
3. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
4. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
5. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
6. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
7. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
8. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
9. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
10. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
11. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
12. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
13. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
14. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
15. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
16. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
17. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
18. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
19. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
20. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
21. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
22. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
23. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
24. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
25. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
26. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
27. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
28. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
29. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
30. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
31. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
32. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
33. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
34. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do.

## [Considerations]:
1. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
2. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
3. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
4. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
5. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
6. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
7. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
8. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
9. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
10. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
11. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
12. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
13. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
14. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
15. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
16. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
17. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
18. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
19. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
20. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
21. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
22. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
23. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
24. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
25. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
26. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
27. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
28. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
29. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
30. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
31. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
32. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
33. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
34. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.

## [Considerations]:
1. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
2. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
3. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
4. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
5. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
6. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
7. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
8. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
9. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
10. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
11. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
12. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
13. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
14. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
15. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
16. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
17. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
18. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
19. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
20. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
21. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
22. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
23. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
24. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
25. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
26. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
27. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
28. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
29. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
30. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
31. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
32. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
33. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
34. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.

## [Considerations]:
1. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
2. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
3. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
4. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
5. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
6. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
7. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
8. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
9. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
10. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
11. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
12. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
13. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
14. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
15. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
16. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
17. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
18. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
19. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
20. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
21. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
22. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
23. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
24. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
25. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
26. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
27. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
28. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
29. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
30. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
31. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
32. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
33. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
34. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
35. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. ","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
2. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
3. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
4. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
5. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
6. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
7. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
8. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
9. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
10. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
11. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
12. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
13. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
14. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
15. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
16. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
17. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
18. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
19. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
20. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
21. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
22. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
23. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
24. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
25. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
26. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
27. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
28. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
29. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
30. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
31. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
32. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
33. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
34. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
35. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
2. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
3. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
4. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
5. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
6. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
7. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
8. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
9. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
10. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
11. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
12. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
13. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
14. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
15. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
16. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
17. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
18. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
19. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
20. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
21. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
22. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
23. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
24. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
25. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
26. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
27. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
28. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
29. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
30. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
31. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
32. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
33. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
34. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
35. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.","1. 2

11. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
12. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
13. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals.

## [Considerations]:
1. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
2. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
3. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
4. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
5. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
6. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
7. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
8. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
9. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
10. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
11. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
12. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
13. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
14. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
15. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
16. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
17. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
18. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
19. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
20. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
21. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
22. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
23. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
24. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
25. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
26. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
27. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
28. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
29. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
30. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
31. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
32. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
33. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
34. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
35. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
36. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
37. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
38. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
39. Genome editing is really cool science.
40. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
41. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
42. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
43. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
44. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.

3. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
4. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
5. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
6. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
7. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
8. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
9. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
10. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
11. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
12. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
13. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
14. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
15. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
16. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
17. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
18. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
19. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
20. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
21. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
22. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
23. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
24. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
25. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
26. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
27. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
28. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
29. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
30. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.

1. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
2. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
3. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
4. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
5. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
6. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
7. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
8. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
9. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
10. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
11. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
12. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
13. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
14. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
15. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
16. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
17. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
18. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
19. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
20. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
21. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
22. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
23. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
24. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
25. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
26. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
27. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
28. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
29. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
30. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
31. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
32. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
33. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
34. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
35. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
36. Genome editing is really cool science.
37. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
38. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
39. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
40. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
41. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.

5. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
6. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
7. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
8. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
9. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
10. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
11. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
12. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
13. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
14. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
15. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
16. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
17. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
18. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
19. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
20. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
21. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
22. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.

## [Considerations]:
1. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
2. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
3. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
4. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
5. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
6. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
7. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
8. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
9. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
10. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
11. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
12. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
13. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.

17. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
18. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
19. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
20. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
21. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
22. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
23. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.

## [Considerations]:
1. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
2. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
3. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
4. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
5. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
6. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
7. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
8. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
9. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
10. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
11. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
12. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
13. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
14. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
15. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
16. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
17. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
18. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
19. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
20. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
21. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
22. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
23. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
24. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
25. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
26. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
27. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
28. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
29. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
30. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
31. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
32. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
33. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
34. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
35. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
36. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
37. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
38. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
39. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
40. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
41. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
42. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
43. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
44. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
45. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
46. Genetic research will improve our lives.
47. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
48. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.

16. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
17. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
18. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
19. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
20. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
21. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.

## [Considerations]:
1. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
2. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
3. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
4. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
5. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
6. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
7. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
8. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
9. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
10. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
11. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
12. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
13. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
14. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
15. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
16. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
17. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
18. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
19. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
20. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
21. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
22. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
23. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
24. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
25. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
26. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
27. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
28. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
29. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
30. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
31. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
32. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
33. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
34. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
35. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
36. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
37. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
38. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
39. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
40. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
41. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
42. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
43. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
44. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
45. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
46. Genetic research will improve our lives.

4. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
5. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
6. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
7. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
8. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
9. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
10. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
11. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
12. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
13. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
14. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
15. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
16. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
17. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
18. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
19. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
20. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
21. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
22. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
23. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
24. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
25. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
26. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
27. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
28. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
29. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
30. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
31. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
32. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
33. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.

## [Considerations]:
1. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
2. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
3. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
4. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
5. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
6. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
7. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
8. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
9. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
10. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
11. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
12. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
13. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
14. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
15. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
16. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
17. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
18. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
19. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
20. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
21. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
22. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
23. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
24. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
25. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
26. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
27. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
28. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
29. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
30. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
31. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
32. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.

## [Considerations]:
1. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
2. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
3. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
4. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
5. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
6. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
7. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
8. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
9. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
10. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
11. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
12. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
13. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
14. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
15. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
16. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
17. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
18. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
19. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
20. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
21. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
22. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
23. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
24. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
25. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
26. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
27. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
28. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
29. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
30. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
31. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
2. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
3. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
4. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
5. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
6. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
7. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
8. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
9. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
10. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
11. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
12. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
13. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
14. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
15. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
16. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
17. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
18. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
19. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
20. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
21. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
22. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
23. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
24. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
25. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
26. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
27. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
28. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
29. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
30. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
31. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
2. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
3. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
4. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
5. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
6. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
7. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
8. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
9. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
10. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
11. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
12. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
13. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
14. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
15. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
16. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
17. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
18. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
19. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
20. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
21. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
22. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
23. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
24. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
25.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
26. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
27. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
28. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
29. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
30. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
31. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
32. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
33. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
34. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
35. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
36. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
37. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
38. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
39. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
40. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
41. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
42. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
43. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
44. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
45. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.","1. 11

## [Considerations]:
1. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
2. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
3. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
4. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
5. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
6. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
7. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
8. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
9. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
10. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
11. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
12. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
13. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
14. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
15. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
16. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
17. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
18. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
19. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
20. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
21. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
22. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
23. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
24. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
25. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
26. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
27. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
28. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
29. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
30. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
31. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
32. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
33. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
34. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
35. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
36. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
37. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
38. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
39. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
40. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
41. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
42. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
