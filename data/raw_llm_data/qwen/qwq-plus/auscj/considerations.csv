Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.",C2. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.,C3. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.,C4. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.,C5. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.,C6. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.,C7. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.,C8. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.,C9. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.,"C10. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.","C11. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.",C12. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.,C13. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.,C14. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.,C15. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.,"C16.

When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.,C23. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. ,C24. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.,C25. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.,C26. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.,C27. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.,C28. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.,C29. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.,C30. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.,"C31. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.",C32. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. ,"C33. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.",C34. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.,"C35. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.",C36. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing,C37. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.,C38. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.,"C39. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.",C40. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.,C41. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.,C42. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.,C43. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.,"C44. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.",C45. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
