## [Considerations]:
1. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
2. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
3. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
4. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
5. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
6. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
7. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
8. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
9. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
10. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
11. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
12. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
13. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
14. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
15. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
16. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
17. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
18. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
19. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
20. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
21. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
22. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
23. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
24. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
25. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
26. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
27. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
28. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
29. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
30. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
31. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
32. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
33. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
34. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
35. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
36. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
37. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
38. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
39. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
40. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
41. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
42. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
43. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. Native animals in the Daintree need protection because they have a right to life which cannot be traded against economic considerations.
2. I think that both short and long term perspectives are needed in deciding what should be done with the Bloomfield Track, but I don't know which one is more important.
3. If we don't take steps to protect the Daintree Rainforest future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the area as we do now.
4. The most important use of the Bloomfield Track is for tourism.
5. The Bloomfield Track may not have been the best idea, but I guess there is probably little point in closing it now that it has been built.
6. I would be worse off if more of the Daintree rainforest is protected.
7. I'm concerned that I will be made worse off by any decision about the Bloomfield Track.
8. If future generations could have their say about the Bloomfield track, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
9. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track is permanently damaging the coral reefs that fringe the beaches below
10. Any decision about the Bloomfield Track will greatly affect people like me.
11. I don't like how development is creeping further and further North into the Daintree and beyond because of its effect on the environment.
12. The future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by everyone and not just by those who live in the Bloomfield area.
13. The protection of plants and animals in the Daintree is OK so long as it doesn't affect me.
14. I'm not sure if the future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by locals, outsiders or both.
15. I don't know how, but I think that there must be some way in which everybody benefits from protecting the rainforest near the Bloomfield Track.
16. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track does not cause siltation or damage to the fringing inshore reefs between Cape Tribulation and Cooktown
17. The fate of the Bloomfield Track is of no concern to me.
18. In deciding on what to do with the Bloomfield Track I don't know whether it's more important to meet the needs of the community or the environment.
19. Using cars on the Bloomfield Track is bad for the rainforest.
20. Laying bitumen on the Bloomfield Track would be beneficial for the environment
21. The more that it is possible for the average North Queensland resident can access the Bloomfield Track the better
22. I don't know if improving the Bloomfield Track would lead to a rapid acceleration of development in the area to the detriment of the environment.
23. There is no reason to believe that the Daintree Rainforest is under threat.
24. I don't really know who benefits most from the protection of Rainforest in the Daintree.
25. The Wujal Wujal Community is better off now that the Bloomfield Track has been built.
26. Whilst impacts on locals in the Bloomfield area are a concern, it is the broader community that should carry more weight when deciding what to do with the Bloomfield Track.
27. The coral reefs along the foreshore below the Bloomfield Track are not badly affected by the road.
28. Conservation in the Daintree area is worthwhile at whatever cost.
29. A long term perspective on the Bloomfield Track is essential.
30. Let's fix the problems in the Daintree just for now. The future will take care of itself.
31. The Bloomfield Track issue is important for Queensland.
32. The Bloomfield Track is important because it allows quick access to remote areas of the North.
33. The road is just the 'thin edge of the wedge'. This may not happen for a long time, but it will happen.
34. Economic development associated with the Bloomfield Track will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
35. Everyone in Queensland is better off for having a road like the Bloomfield Track.
36. When it comes to the Bloomfield Track, it's not important to worry about what the future will hold
37. When it comes to the Bloomfield track, people living in Cairns are in no position to judge what the interests of the local residents of Bloomfield are.
38. I have no idea what the people in the Bloomfield area think about the Bloomfield Track.
39. If the Bloomfield Track is sealed (bitumenized) there will not be a rapid increase in environmentally damaging development in the Daintree area in the future It may even benefit the environment there.
40. No development should be permitted in World Heritage areas such as the Daintree.
41. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Daintree region because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
42. I don't know what the people of Bloomfield think about the Bloomfield Track.","1. 10

24. If we don't take steps to protect the Daintree Rainforest future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the area as we do now.
25. The protection of plants and animals in the Daintree is OK so long as it doesn't affect me.
26. The Bloomfield Track is important because it allows quick access to remote areas of the North.
27. If the Bloomfield Track is sealed (bitumenized) there will not be a rapid increase in environmentally damaging development in the Daintree area in the future It may even benefit the environment there.
28. In deciding on what to do with the Bloomfield Track I don't know whether it's more important to meet the needs of the community or the environment.

## [Considerations]:
1. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
2. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
3. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
4. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
5. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
6. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
7. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
8. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
9. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
10. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
11. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
12. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
13. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
14. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
15. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
16. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
17. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
18. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
19. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
20. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
21. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
22. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
23. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
24. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
25. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
26. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
27. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
28. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
29. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
30. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
31. Forest health means jobs.
32. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
33. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
34. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
35. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
36. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
37. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
38. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
39. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
40. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
41. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
42. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
43. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
44. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
45. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.","1. 11

22. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
23. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
24. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
25. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.

## [Considerations]:
1. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
2. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
3. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
4. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
5. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
6. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
7. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
8. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
9. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
10. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
11. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
12. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
13. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
14. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
15. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
16. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
17. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
18. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
19. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
20. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
21. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
22. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
23. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
24. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
25. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
26. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
27. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
28. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
29. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
30. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
31. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
32. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
33. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
34. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
35. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
36. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
37. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
38. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
39. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
40. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
41. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
42. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
43. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.","1. 2

2. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
3. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
4. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
5. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.
6. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
7. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
8. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
9. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
10. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
11. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
12. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
13. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
14. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
15. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
16. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
17. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
18. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process
19. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
20. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
21. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
22. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
23. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
24. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
25. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.
26. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
27. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
28. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
29. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
30. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
31. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
32. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
33. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
34. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities
35. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.

20. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
21. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
22. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.

24. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
25. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
26. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
27. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
28. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
29. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
30. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
31. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
32. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.

34. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
35. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion

## [Considerations]:
1. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
2. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
3. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
4. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
5. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
6. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
7. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
8. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
9. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
10. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
11. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
12. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
13. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
14. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
15. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
16. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
17. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
18. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
19. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
20. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
21. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
22. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
23. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
24. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
25. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
26. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
27. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
28. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
29. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
30. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
31. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
32. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
33. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
34. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
35. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
36. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
37. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
38. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
39. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
40. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
41. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
