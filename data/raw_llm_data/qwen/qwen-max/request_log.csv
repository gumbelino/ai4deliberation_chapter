## [Considerations]:
1. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
2. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
3. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
4. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
5. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
6. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
7. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
8. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
9. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
10. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
11. People get the government they deserve
12. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
13. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
14. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
15. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
16. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
17. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
18. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
19. I'm always cynical about government processes.
20. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
21. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
22. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
23. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
24. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
25. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
26. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
27. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
28. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
29. We live in a great democracy.
30. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
31. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
32. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
33. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
34. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
35. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
36. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
37. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
38. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
39. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
40. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
41. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
42. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
43. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
44. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
45. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
46. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
47. We are a democratic country.

4. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
5. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
6. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
7. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
8. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
9. We can adapt to the coming changes.
10. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
11. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
12. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
13. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
14. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
15. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
16. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
17. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
18. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
19. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
20. I care about the planet.
21. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.

23. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
24. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
25. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
26. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
27. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
28. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?

## [Considerations]:
1. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
2. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
3. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
4. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
5. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
6. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
7. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
8. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
9. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
10. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
11. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
12. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
13. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
14. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
15. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
16. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
17. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
18. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
19. Forest health means jobs.
20. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
21. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
22. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
23. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
24. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
25. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
26. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
27. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
28. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
29. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
30. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
31. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
32. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
33. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
34. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
35. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
36. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
37. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
38. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
39. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
40. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
41. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
42. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
43. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
44. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat.

2. Food waste is a major environmental issue
3. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
4. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
5. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
6. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
7. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
8. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
9. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
10. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
11. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
12. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
13. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
14. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
15. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
16. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
17. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
18. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
19. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
20. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
21. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
22. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
23. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
24. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
25. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy

## [Considerations]:
1. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
2. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
3. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
4. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
5. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
6. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
7. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
8. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
9. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
10. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
11. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
12. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
13. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
14. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
15. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
16. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
17. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
18. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
19. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
20. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
2. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
3. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
4. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
5. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
6. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
7. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
8. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
9. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
10. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
11. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
12. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
13. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
14. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
15. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
16. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
17. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
18. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
19. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
20. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
21. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
22. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
23. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
24. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
25. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
26. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
27. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
28. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
29. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
30. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
31. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
32. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
33. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
34. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
35. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
36. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
37. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
38. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
39. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
40. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
41. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
42. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
43. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.","1. 7

4. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
5. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
6. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
7. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
8.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
9. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
10. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
11. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
12. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
13. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
14. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
15. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
16. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
17. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
18. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
19. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
20. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
21. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
22. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
23. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
24. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
25. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
26. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
27. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
28. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
29. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
30. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
31. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
32. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
33. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
34. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
35. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
36. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
37. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
38. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
39. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
40. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
41. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
42. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
43. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
44. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
45. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.","1. 3

20. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
21. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
22. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power

## [Considerations]:
1. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
2. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
3. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
4. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
5. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
6. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
7. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
8. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
9. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
10. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
11. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
12. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
13. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
14. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
15. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
16. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
17. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
18. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
19. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
20. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
21. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
22. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
23. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
24. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
25. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
26. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
27. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
28. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
29. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
30. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
31. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
32. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
33. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
34. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
2. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
3. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
4. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
5. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
6. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
7. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
8. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
9. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
10. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
11. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
12. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
13. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
14. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
15. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
16. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
17. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
18. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
19. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
20. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
21. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
22. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
23. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
24. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. In deciding on what to do with the Bloomfield Track I don't know whether it's more important to meet the needs of the community or the environment.
2. I don't like how development is creeping further and further North into the Daintree and beyond because of its effect on the environment.
3. Whilst impacts on locals in the Bloomfield area are a concern, it is the broader community that should carry more weight when deciding what to do with the Bloomfield Track.
4. The protection of plants and animals in the Daintree is OK so long as it doesn't affect me.
5. The Bloomfield Track may not have been the best idea, but I guess there is probably little point in closing it now that it has been built.
6. Laying bitumen on the Bloomfield Track would be beneficial for the environment
7. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track does not cause siltation or damage to the fringing inshore reefs between Cape Tribulation and Cooktown
8. No development should be permitted in World Heritage areas such as the Daintree.
9. Economic development associated with the Bloomfield Track will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
10. I don't know what the people of Bloomfield think about the Bloomfield Track.
11. If future generations could have their say about the Bloomfield track, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
12. I would be worse off if more of the Daintree rainforest is protected.
13. When it comes to the Bloomfield Track, it's not important to worry about what the future will hold
14. A long term perspective on the Bloomfield Track is essential.
15. The most important use of the Bloomfield Track is for tourism.
16. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track is permanently damaging the coral reefs that fringe the beaches below
17. If we don't take steps to protect the Daintree Rainforest future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the area as we do now.
18. I'm concerned that I will be made worse off by any decision about the Bloomfield Track.
19. The more that it is possible for the average North Queensland resident can access the Bloomfield Track the better
20. Native animals in the Daintree need protection because they have a right to life which cannot be traded against economic considerations.
21. Any decision about the Bloomfield Track will greatly affect people like me.
22. The Wujal Wujal Community is better off now that the Bloomfield Track has been built.
23. Using cars on the Bloomfield Track is bad for the rainforest.
24. The fate of the Bloomfield Track is of no concern to me.
25. The Bloomfield Track issue is important for Queensland.
26. The road is just the 'thin edge of the wedge'. This may not happen for a long time, but it will happen.
27. I think that both short and long term perspectives are needed in deciding what should be done with the Bloomfield Track, but I don't know which one is more important.
28. There is no reason to believe that the Daintree Rainforest is under threat.
29. Conservation in the Daintree area is worthwhile at whatever cost.
30. Everyone in Queensland is better off for having a road like the Bloomfield Track.
31. When it comes to the Bloomfield track, people living in Cairns are in no position to judge what the interests of the local residents of Bloomfield are.
32. The future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by everyone and not just by those who live in the Bloomfield area.
33. I don't know how, but I think that there must be some way in which everybody benefits from protecting the rainforest near the Bloomfield Track.
34. I don't really know who benefits most from the protection of Rainforest in the Daintree.
35. I have no idea what the people in the Bloomfield area think about the Bloomfield Track.
36. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Daintree region because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
37. Let's fix the problems in the Daintree just for now. The future will take care of itself.
38. I'm not sure if the future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by locals, outsiders or both.
39. The Bloomfield Track is important because it allows quick access to remote areas of the North.
40. If the Bloomfield Track is sealed (bitumenized) there will not be a rapid increase in environmentally damaging development in the Daintree area in the future It may even benefit the environment there.
41. The coral reefs along the foreshore below the Bloomfield Track are not badly affected by the road.
42. I don't know if improving the Bloomfield Track would lead to a rapid acceleration of development in the area to the detriment of the environment.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
2. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
3. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
4. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
5. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
6. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
7. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
8. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
9. People get the government they deserve
10. I'm always cynical about government processes.
11. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
12. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
13. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
14. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
15. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
16. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
17. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
18. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
19. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
20. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
21. We live in a great democracy.
22. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
23. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
24. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
25. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
26. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
27. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
28. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
29. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
30. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
31. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
32. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
33. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
34. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
35. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
36. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
37. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
38. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
39. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
40. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
41. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
42. We are a democratic country.
43. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
44. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
45. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
46. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
47. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
48. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
2. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
3. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
4. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
5. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
6. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
7. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
8. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
9. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
10. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
11. We are a democratic country.
12. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
13. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
14. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
15. We live in a great democracy.
16. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
17. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
18. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
19. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
20. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
21. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
22. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
23. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
24. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
25. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
26. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
27. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
28. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
29. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
30. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
31. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
32. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
33. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
34. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
35. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
36. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
37. People get the government they deserve
38. I'm always cynical about government processes.
39. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
40. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
41. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
42. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
43. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
44. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
45. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
46. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.

## [Considerations]:
1. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
2. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
3. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
4. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
5. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
6. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
7. We live in a great democracy.
8. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
9. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
10. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
11. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
12. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
13. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
14. We are a democratic country.
15. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
16. I'm always cynical about government processes.
17. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
18. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
19. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
20. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
21. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
22. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
23. People get the government they deserve
24. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
25. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
26. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
27. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
28. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
29. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
30. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
31. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
32. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
33. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
34. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
35. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
36. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
37. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
38. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
39. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
40. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
41. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
42. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
43. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
44. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
45. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
46. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
47. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
48. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.","1. 8

1. We can adapt to the coming changes.
2. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
3. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.

5. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
6. I care about the planet.
7. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
8. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
9. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
10. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
11. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
12. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
13. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
14. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
15. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
16. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
17. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
18. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
19. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
20. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
21. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
22. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
23. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
24. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
25. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
26. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
27. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
28. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
29. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries.

5. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
6. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
7. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
8. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
9. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
10. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
11. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.

13. We can adapt to the coming changes.
14. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
15. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
16. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
17. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
18. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
19. I care about the planet.
20. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
21. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
22. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.

## [Considerations]:
1. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
2. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
3. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
4. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
5. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
6. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
7. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
8. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
9. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
10. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
11. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
12. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
13. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
14. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
15. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
16. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
17. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
18. Forest health means jobs.
19. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
20. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
21. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
22. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
23. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
24. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
25. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
26. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
27. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
28. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
29. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
30. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
31. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
32. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
33. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
34. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
35. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
36. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
37. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
38. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
39. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
40. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
41. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
42. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
43. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
44. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
45. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. ","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
2. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
3. Forest health means jobs.
4. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
5. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
6. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
7. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
8. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
9. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
10. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
11. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
12. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
13. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
14. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
15. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
16. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
17. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
18. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
19. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
20. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
21. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
22. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
23. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
24. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
25. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
26. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
27. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
28. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
29. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
30. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
31. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
32. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
33. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
34. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
35. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
36. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
37. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
38. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
39. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
40. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
41. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
42. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
43. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
44. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
45. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
2. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
3. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
4. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
5. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
6. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
7. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
8. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
9. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
10. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
11. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
12. Forest health means jobs.
13. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
14. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
15. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
16. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
17. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
18. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
19. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
20. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
21. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
22. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
23. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
24. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
25. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
26. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
27. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
28. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
29. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
30. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
31. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
32. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
33. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
34. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
35. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
36. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
37. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
38. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
39. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
40. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
41. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
42. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
43. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
44. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
45. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. ","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. Participants who donate their samples for research should be given special access to the treatments and therapies that result from that research. 
2. Policy makers should consider the possibility that Canada should not pursue biobanking.
3. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
4. Genetic studies of disability will lead to the discrimination of people living with the same conditions.
5. Profits from biobanking should be returned to the donating community. 
6. All participants should be paid for donating their samples to a biobank. 
7. To me, religious communities need to be consulted about genetic and biobank research. 
8. Genetic information is different from health information. 
9. It is always permissible to do research on my personally identifiable sample without my prior permission.  
10. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government. 
11. The priority for healthcare should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
12. There is no point in consulting the public about ethical issues in science and technology.
13. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.  
14. Biobanks need independent review boards to determine who should have access to samples. 
15. Educating people about health issues (e.g. diet and lifestyle changes) promises greater health effects than investing in biobanks.
16. I trust researchers to control access to my personal samples.
17. Biobanks will only lead to expensive treatments and high profits. 
18. The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  
19. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
20. My personal sample should never be anonymized since I should be informed of important research results.  
21. If someone is a carrier of a genetic disease, they have a responsibility to participate in genetic research.
22. Participants should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at anytime. 
23. Sampling some people in an ethnocultural community is acceptable only if the whole ethnocultural community has agreed to participate.
24. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health.
25. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies.
26. There is no risk to the participants who donate to biobanks.
27. I should have property rights to my tissues before or after they leave my body.
28. Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.
29. Aboriginal communities require special consideration concerning healthcare and research.
30. Genetic research will improve our lives.
31. Genetic studies of race on enthocultural communities will lead to the discrimination of those same enthocultural communities. 
32. Participants should be active in the set up and oversight of  biobanks. 
33. I do not care if my donated sample is connected to my name and medical information.
34. Participants should be contacted every time researchers want to use their samples for research.
35. Scientists should have access to all unidentified, personal samples for research.
36. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for bothers me. 
37. Researchers should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.  
38. Everyone should donate samples to a biobank for the benefit of everyone. ","1. 8

2. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
3. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
4. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
5. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
6. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
7. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
8. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
9. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
10. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
11. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
12. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
13. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
14. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
15. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
16. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
17. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
18. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
19. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
20. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
21. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
22. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
23. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
24. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
25. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.

## [Considerations]:
1. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
2. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
3. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
4. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
5. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
6. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
7. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
8. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
9. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
10. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
11. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
12. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
13. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
14. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
15. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
16. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
17. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
18. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
19. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
20. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
21. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
22. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
23. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
24. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
25. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
26. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
27. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
28. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
29. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.

## [Considerations]:
1. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
2. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
3. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
4. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
5. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
6. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
7. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
8. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
9. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
10. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
11. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
12. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
13. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
14. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
15. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
16. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
17. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
18. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
19. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
20. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
21. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
22. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
23. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
24. Food waste is a major environmental issue
25. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
26. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
27. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
28. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
29. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
30. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste","1. 5

4. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
5. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
6. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
7. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
8. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
9. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
10. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
11. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
12. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.

14. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
15. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
16. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
17. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
18. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
19. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
20. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
21. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
22. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
23. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
24. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
25. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
26. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
27. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
28. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
29. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.

## [Considerations]:
1. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
2. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
3. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
4. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
5. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
6. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
7. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
8. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
9. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
10. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
11. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
12. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
13. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
14. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
15. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
16. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
17. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
18. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
19. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
20. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
21. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
22. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
23. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
24. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
25. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
26. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
27. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.

## [Considerations]:
1. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
2. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
3. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
4. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
5. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
6. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
7. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
8. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
9. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
10. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
11. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
12. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
13. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
14. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
15. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
16. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
17. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
18. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
19. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
20. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
21. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
22. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
23. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
24. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
25. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
26. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
27. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
28. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
29. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
30. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
31. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
32. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
33. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
34. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
35. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
36. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
37. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
38. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
39. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.

## [Considerations]:
1. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
2. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
3. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
4. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
5. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
6. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
7. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
8. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
9. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
10. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
11. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
12. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
13. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
14. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
15. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
16. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
17. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
18. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
19. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
20. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
21. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
22. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
23. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
24. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
25. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
26. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
27. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
28. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
29. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
30. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
31. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
32. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
33. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
34. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
35. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
36. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
37. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
38. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
39. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
40. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
41. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
42. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
43. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
2. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
3. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
4. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
5. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
6. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
7. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
8. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
9. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
10. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
11. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
12. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
13. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
14. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
15. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
16. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
17. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
18. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
19. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
20. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
21. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
22. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
23. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
24. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
25. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
26. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
27. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
28. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
29. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
30. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
31. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
32.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
33. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.

## [Considerations]:
1. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
2. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
3. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
4. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
5. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
6. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
7. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
8. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
9. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
10. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
11. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
12. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
13. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
14. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
15.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
16. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
17. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
18. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
19. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
20. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
21. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
22. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
23. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
24. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
25. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
26. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
27. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
28. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
29. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
30. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
31. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
32. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
33. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
34. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
35. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
36. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
37. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
38. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
39. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
40. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
41. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
42. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
43. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
44. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
45. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
2. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
3. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
4. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
5. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
6. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
7. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
8. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
9. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
10. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
11. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
12. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
13. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
14. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
15.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
16. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
17. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
18. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
19. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
20. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
21. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
22. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
23. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
24. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
25. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
26. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
27. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
28. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
29. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
30. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
31. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
32. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
33. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
34. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
35. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
36. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
37. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
38. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
39. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
40. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
41. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
42. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
43. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
44. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
45. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.","1. 9

19. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
20. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
21. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
22. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
23. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
24. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
25. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
26. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
27. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
28. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
29. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
30. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
31. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
32. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
33. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
34. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
35. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
36. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
37. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
38. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
39. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
40. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
41. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
42. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
43.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
44. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
45. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.","1. 8

1. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
2. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
3. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
4. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
5. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
6. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
7. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
8. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
9. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
10. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
11. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
12. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
13. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
14. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
15. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
16. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
17. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
18. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
19. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
20. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
21. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
22. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
23. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
24. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
25. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
26. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
27. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
28. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
29. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.

## [Considerations]:
1. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
2. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
3. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.
4. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
5. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
6. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
7. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
8. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
9. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
10. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
11. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
12. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.
13. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
14. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
15. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
16. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
17. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
18. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
19. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
20. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
21. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
22. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
23. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
24. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities
25. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
26. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
27. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
28. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
29. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
30. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
31. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
32. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process
33. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
34. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
35. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
36. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.","1. 3

9. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
10. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
11. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services

22. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
23. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
24. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
25. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens

1. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
2. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
3. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
4. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
5. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
6. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
7. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
8. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
9. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
10. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
11. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
12. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
13. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
14. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
15. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
16. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
17. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
18. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
19. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
20. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
21. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
22. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
23. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
24. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
25. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
26. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
27. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
28. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
29. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
30. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
31. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
32. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
33. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.

6. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
7. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
8. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
9. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
10. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.

12. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
13. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
14. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
15. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
16. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
17. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
18. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
19. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
20. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.

## [Considerations]:
1. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
2. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
3. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
4. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
5. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
6. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
7. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
8. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
9. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
10. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
11. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
12. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
13. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
14. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
15. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
16. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
17. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
18. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
19. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
20. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
21. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
22. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
23. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
24. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
25. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
26. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
27. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
28. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
29. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
30. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
31. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
32. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
33. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
34. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
35. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
36. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.

## [Considerations]:
1. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
2. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
3. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
4. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
5. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
6. Genome editing is really cool science.
7. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
8. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
9. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
10. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
11. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
12. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
13. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
14. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
15. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
16. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
17. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
18. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
19. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
20. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
21. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
22. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
23. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
24. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
25. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
26. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
27. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
28. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
29. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
30. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
31. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
32. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
33. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
34. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
35. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
36. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
37. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
38. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
39. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
40. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
41. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
42. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
43. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
44. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.

## [Considerations]:
1. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
2. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
3. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
4. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
5. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
6. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
7. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
8. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
9. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
10. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
11. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
12. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
13. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
14. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
15. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
16. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
17. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
18. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
19. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
20. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
21. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
22. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
23. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
24. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.","1. 7

1. Genetic research will improve our lives.
2. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
3. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
4. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
5. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
6. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
7. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
8. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
9. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
10. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
11. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
12. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
13. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
14. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
15. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
16. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
17. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
18. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
19. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
20. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
21. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
22. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
23. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
24. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
25. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
26. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
27. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
28. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
29. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
30. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
31. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
32. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
33. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
34. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
35. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
36. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
37. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
38. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
39. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
40. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
41. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
42. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
43. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
44. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
45. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
46. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
47. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
48. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
49. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
2. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
3. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
4. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
5. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
6. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
7. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
8. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
9. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
10. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
11. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
12. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
13. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
14. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
15. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
16. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
17. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
18. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
19. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
20. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
21. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
22. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
23. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
24. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
25. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
26. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
27. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
28. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
29. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
30. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
31. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
32. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
33. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
34. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
35. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”

## [Considerations]:
1. In deciding on what to do with the Bloomfield Track I don't know whether it's more important to meet the needs of the community or the environment.
2. I don't like how development is creeping further and further North into the Daintree and beyond because of its effect on the environment.
3. Whilst impacts on locals in the Bloomfield area are a concern, it is the broader community that should carry more weight when deciding what to do with the Bloomfield Track.
4. The protection of plants and animals in the Daintree is OK so long as it doesn't affect me.
5. The Bloomfield Track may not have been the best idea, but I guess there is probably little point in closing it now that it has been built.
6. Laying bitumen on the Bloomfield Track would be beneficial for the environment
7. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track does not cause siltation or damage to the fringing inshore reefs between Cape Tribulation and Cooktown
8. No development should be permitted in World Heritage areas such as the Daintree.
9. Economic development associated with the Bloomfield Track will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
10. I don't know what the people of Bloomfield think about the Bloomfield Track.
11. If future generations could have their say about the Bloomfield track, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
12. I would be worse off if more of the Daintree rainforest is protected.
13. When it comes to the Bloomfield Track, it's not important to worry about what the future will hold
14. A long term perspective on the Bloomfield Track is essential.
15. The most important use of the Bloomfield Track is for tourism.
16. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track is permanently damaging the coral reefs that fringe the beaches below
17. If we don't take steps to protect the Daintree Rainforest future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the area as we do now.
18. I'm concerned that I will be made worse off by any decision about the Bloomfield Track.
19. The more that it is possible for the average North Queensland resident can access the Bloomfield Track the better
20. Native animals in the Daintree need protection because they have a right to life which cannot be traded against economic considerations.
21. Any decision about the Bloomfield Track will greatly affect people like me.
22. The Wujal Wujal Community is better off now that the Bloomfield Track has been built.
23. Using cars on the Bloomfield Track is bad for the rainforest.
24. The fate of the Bloomfield Track is of no concern to me.
25. The Bloomfield Track issue is important for Queensland.
26. The road is just the 'thin edge of the wedge'. This may not happen for a long time, but it will happen.
27. I think that both short and long term perspectives are needed in deciding what should be done with the Bloomfield Track, but I don't know which one is more important.
28. There is no reason to believe that the Daintree Rainforest is under threat.
29. Conservation in the Daintree area is worthwhile at whatever cost.
30. Everyone in Queensland is better off for having a road like the Bloomfield Track.
31. When it comes to the Bloomfield track, people living in Cairns are in no position to judge what the interests of the local residents of Bloomfield are.
32. The future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by everyone and not just by those who live in the Bloomfield area.
33. I don't know how, but I think that there must be some way in which everybody benefits from protecting the rainforest near the Bloomfield Track.
34. I don't really know who benefits most from the protection of Rainforest in the Daintree.
35. I have no idea what the people in the Bloomfield area think about the Bloomfield Track.
36. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Daintree region because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
37. Let's fix the problems in the Daintree just for now. The future will take care of itself.
38. I'm not sure if the future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by locals, outsiders or both.
39. The Bloomfield Track is important because it allows quick access to remote areas of the North.
40. If the Bloomfield Track is sealed (bitumenized) there will not be a rapid increase in environmentally damaging development in the Daintree area in the future It may even benefit the environment there.
41. The coral reefs along the foreshore below the Bloomfield Track are not badly affected by the road.
42. I don't know if improving the Bloomfield Track would lead to a rapid acceleration of development in the area to the detriment of the environment.","1. 6

3. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.

14. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
15. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.

19. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
20. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
21. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.

33. We are a democratic country.
34. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
35. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
36. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
37. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
38. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.

40. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
41. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
42. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
43. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
44. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
45. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
46. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
47. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.

## [Considerations]:
1. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
2. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
3. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
4. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
5. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
6. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
7. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
8. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
9. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
10. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
11. We live in a great democracy.
12. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
13. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
14. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
15. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
16. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
17. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
18. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
19. We are a democratic country.
20. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
21. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
22. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
23. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
24. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
25. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
26. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
27. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
28. I'm always cynical about government processes.
29. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
30. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
31. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
32. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
33. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
34. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
35. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
36. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
37. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
38. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
39. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
40. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
41. People get the government they deserve
42. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
43. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
44. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
45. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
46. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
47. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
48. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. ","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
2. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
3. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
4. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
5. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
6. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
7. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
8. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
9. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
10. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
11. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
12. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
13. People get the government they deserve
14. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
15. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
16. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
17. We are a democratic country.
18. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
19. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
20. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
21. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
22. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
23. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
24. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
25. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
26. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
27. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
28. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
29. We live in a great democracy.
30. I'm always cynical about government processes.
31. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
32. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
33. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
34. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
35. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
36. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
37. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
38. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
39. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
40. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
41. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
42. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
43. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
44. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
45. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
46. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
47. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
48. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
2. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
3. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
4. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
5. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
6. We are a democratic country.
7. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
8. People get the government they deserve
9. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
10. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
11. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
12. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
13. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
14. I'm always cynical about government processes.
15. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
16. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
17. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
18. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
19. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
20. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
21. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
22. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
23. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
24. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
25. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
26. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
27. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
28. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
29. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
30. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
31. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
32. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
33. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
34. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
35. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
36. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
37. We live in a great democracy.
38. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
39. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
40. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
41. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
42. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
43. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
44. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
45. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
46. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
47. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
48. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. ","1. 3

15. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
16. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
17. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
18. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
19. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
20. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
21. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.

23. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
24. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
25. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.

29. I'm always cynical about government processes.
30. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
31. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
32. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
33. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
34. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
35. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
36. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
37. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
38. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
39. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
40. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
41. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
42. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
43. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
44. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
45. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
46. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
47. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
48. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
2. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
3. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
4. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
5. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
6. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
7. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
8. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
9. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
10. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
11. We can adapt to the coming changes.
12. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
13. I care about the planet.
14. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
15. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
16. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
17. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
18. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
19. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
20. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
21. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
22. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
23. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
24. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
25. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
26. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
27. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
28. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
29. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
30. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
31. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
32. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
33. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.","1. 9

3. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
4. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
5. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
6. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
7. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
8. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
9. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
10. We can adapt to the coming changes.
11. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
12. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
13. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
14. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
15. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
16. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
17. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
18. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
19. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
20. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.

## [Considerations]:
1. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
2. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
3. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
4. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
5. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
6. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
7. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
8. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
9. We can adapt to the coming changes.
10. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
11. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
12. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
13. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
14. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
15. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
16. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
17. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
18. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
19. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
20. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
21. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
22. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
23. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
24. I care about the planet.
25. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
26. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
27. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
28. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
29. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
30. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
31. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
32. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.

1. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
2. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
3. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
4. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
5. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
6. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
7. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
8. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
9. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
10. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
11. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
12. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
13. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
14. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
15. I care about the planet.
16. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
17. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
18. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
19. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
20. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
21. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
22. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
23. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
24. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
25. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
26. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
27. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
28. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
29. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
30. We can adapt to the coming changes.
31. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
32. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.

## [Considerations]:
1. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
2. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
3. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
4. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
5. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
6. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
7. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
8. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
9. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
10. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
11. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
12. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
13. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
14. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
15. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
16. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
17. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
18. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
19. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
20. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
21. I care about the planet.
22. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
23. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
24. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
25. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
26. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
27. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
28. We can adapt to the coming changes.
29. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
30. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
31. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
32. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
33. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
2. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
3. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
4. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
5. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
6. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
7. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
8. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
9. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
10. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
11. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
12. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
13. Forest health means jobs.
14. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
15. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
16. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
17. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
18. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
19. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
20. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
21. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
22. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
23. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
24. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
25. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
26. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
27. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
28. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
29. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
30. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
31. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
32. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
33. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
34. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
35. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
36. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
37. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
38. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
39. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
40. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
41. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
42. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
43. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
44. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
45. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
2. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
3. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
4. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
5. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
6. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
7. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
8. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
9. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
10. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
11. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
12. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
13. Forest health means jobs.
14. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
15. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
16. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
17. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
18. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
19. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
20. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
21. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
22. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
23. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
24. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
25. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
26. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
27. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
28. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
29. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
30. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
31. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
32. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
33. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
34. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
35. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
36. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
37. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
38. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
39. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
40. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
41. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
42. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
43. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
44. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
45. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
2. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
3. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
4. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
5. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
6. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
7. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
8. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
9. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
10. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
11. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
12. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
13. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
14. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
15. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
16. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
17. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
18. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
19. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
20. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
21. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
22. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
23. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
24. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
25. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
26. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
27. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
28. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
29. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
30. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
31. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
32. Forest health means jobs.
33. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
34. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
35. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
36. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
37. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
38. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
39. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
40. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
41. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
42. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
43. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
44. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
45. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
2. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
3. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
4. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
5. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
6. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
7. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
8. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
9. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
10. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
11. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
12. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
13. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
14. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
15. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
16. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
17. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
18. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
19. Forest health means jobs.
20. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
21. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
22. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
23. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
24. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
25. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
26. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
27. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
28. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
29. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
30. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
31. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
32. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
33. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
34. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
35. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
36. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
37. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
38. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
39. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
40. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
41. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
42. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
43. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
44. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
45. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.","1. 8

4. There is no risk to the participants who donate to biobanks.
5. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
6. Participants should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at anytime. 
7. Genetic research will improve our lives.
8. The priority for healthcare should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
9. I should have property rights to my tissues before or after they leave my body.
10. Policy makers should consider the possibility that Canada should not pursue biobanking.
11. To me, religious communities need to be consulted about genetic and biobank research. 
12. All participants should be paid for donating their samples to a biobank. 
13. If someone is a carrier of a genetic disease, they have a responsibility to participate in genetic research.
14. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government. 
15. Genetic information is different from health information. 
16. Participants should be contacted every time researchers want to use their samples for research.
17. Genetic studies of race on enthocultural communities will lead to the discrimination of those same enthocultural communities.

20. I trust researchers to control access to my personal samples.
21. I do not care if my donated sample is connected to my name and medical information.
22. Everyone should donate samples to a biobank for the benefit of everyone. 
23. Educating people about health issues (e.g. diet and lifestyle changes) promises greater health effects than investing in biobanks.
24. Genetic studies of disability will lead to the discrimination of people living with the same conditions.
25. Participants should be active in the set up and oversight of  biobanks. 
26. Biobanks will only lead to expensive treatments and high profits. 
27. Researchers should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.  
28. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies.
29. Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.
30. The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  
31. Aboriginal communities require special consideration concerning healthcare and research.

## [Considerations]:
1. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
2. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
3. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
4. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
5. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
6. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
7. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
8. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
9. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
10. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
11. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
12. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
13. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
14. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
15. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
16. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
17. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
18. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
19. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
20. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
21. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
22. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
23. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
24. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
25. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
26. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
27. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
28. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
29. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
30. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
31. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.","1. 2

1. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
2. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
3. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
4. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
5. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
6. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
7. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
8. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
9. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
10. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
11. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
12. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
13. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
14. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
15. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
16. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
17. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
18. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
19. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
20. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
21. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
22. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
23. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
24. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
25. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
26. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
27. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
28. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.

3. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
4. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
5. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
6. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
7. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
8. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
9. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
10. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
11. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.

13. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
14. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
15. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
16. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
17. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
18. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
19. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
20. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.

17. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
18. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
19. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
20. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
21. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
22. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
23. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.

27. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
28. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
29. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
30. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
31. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. ","1. 2

1. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
2. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
3. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
4. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
5. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
6. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
7. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
8. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
9. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
10. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
11. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
12. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
13. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
14. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
15. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
16. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
17. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
18. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
19. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
20. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
21. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
22. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
23. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
24. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
25. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
26. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
27. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
28. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
29. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
30. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.

2. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
3. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
4. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
5. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
6. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
7. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
8. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
9. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
10. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
11. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
12. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
13. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
14. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
15. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
16. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.

3. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
4. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
5. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
6. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
7. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
8. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
9. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
10. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
11. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
12. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
13. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
14. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
15. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
16. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
17. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
18. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
19. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
20. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
21. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
22. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products

1. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
2. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
3. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
4. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
5. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
6. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
7. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
8. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
9. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
10. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
11. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
12. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
13. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
14. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
15. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
16. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
17. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
18. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
19. Food waste is a major environmental issue
20. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
21. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
22. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
23. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
24. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
25. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
26. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
27. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
28. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them

## [Considerations]:
1. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
2. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
3. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
4. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
5. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
6. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
7. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
8. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
9. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
10. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
11. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
12. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
13. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
14. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
15. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
16. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
17. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
18. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
19. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
20. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
21. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
22. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
23. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
24. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
25. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
26. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
27. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
28. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.

1. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
2. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
3. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
4. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
5. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
6. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
7. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
8. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
9. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
10. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
11. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
12. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
13. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
14. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
15. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
16. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
17. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
18. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
19. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
20. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
21. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
22. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
23. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
24. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
25. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
26. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
27. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
28. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
29. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
30. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
31. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.

1. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
2. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
3. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
4. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
5. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
6. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
7. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
8. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
9. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
10. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
11. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
12. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
13. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
14. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
15. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
16. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
17. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
18. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
19. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
20. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
21. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
22. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
23. It is certain that climate change exists.
24. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
25. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
26. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
27. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
28. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
29. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
30. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.

## [Considerations]:
1. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
2. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
3. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
4. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
5. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
6. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
7. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
8. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
9. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
10. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
11. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
12. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
13. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
14. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
15. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
16. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
17. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
18. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
19. It is certain that climate change exists.
20. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
21. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
22. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
23. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
24. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
25. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
26. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
27. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
28. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
29. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
30. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
31. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
32. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.

4. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
5. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
6. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
7. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
8. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
9. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.

12. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
13. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
14. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
15. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.

## [Considerations]:
1. The Fremantle Traffic Bridge is the most iconic landmark and the main tourist attraction in Fremantle. 
2. The old bridge will never be able to handle vehicles, bike and pedestrians at the same time.
3. Providing a better pedestrian and cycle traffic should be the main consideration when deciding about the future of the bridge.
4. The bridge is certainly an attractive entry statement to Fremantle and without doubt far more important than trucks.
5. Alterations will lead to nothing but the uglification of the bridge.
6. We should definitely preserve the heritage value of the bridge, but only if it is financially viable.
7. Safe and efficient movement of all road and river users across and under the bridge should the main considerations
8. When deciding about the future of the bridge, indigenous concerns should be given adequate consideration. 
9. The function of the Fremantle Bridge as a transport gateway is more important than its heritage.
10. The old bridge provides a scenic entrance to Fremantle that attracts tourists.
11. Any changes to the bridge should give right consideration to the environment.bridge
12. It is most important that the solution is a long term one.
13. The Fremantle Bridge is irreplaceable. It is a strong, enduring part of our history.
14. The main concern is to have a bridge that underpins the economic activities in the region.
15. The most important issue for cyclists is safety, which means they need access across the bridge which has a good surface.
16. The bridge has stood the test of time for the past 67 years; there's no need for major changes to it.
17. It is worth spending money to retain the iconic status of the bridge.
18. The safety of the bridge is more important than its appearance.
19. The cost of maintaining the old timber structure is too high.
20. This magnificent timber bridge is a rare and beautiful sight in today's world, it should be preserved. 
21. Tax payers money should be spent on services that are more essential than upgrading the bridge.
22. Reducing the risk of vessel collision on the Swan River should be the main consideration when deciding about the future of the bridge
23. The critical infrastructure of the bridge raises serious safety concerns. 
24. River craft deserve better traffic conditions on the Swan River.
25. We just got traffic calming in Town Centre after 25 years effort. I don't want bridge to be build bigger, better faster to reverse the gains of the last 25 years.
26. The most important thing is that access to Fremantle from its north is maintained in the most undisturbed manner as possible. 
27. The existing bridge is too low; archways too narrow and do not line up with the railway bridge making navigation dangerous. 
28. Indigenous people would want to minimize impact on the Swan River, a registered site, that is of importance and significance to them.
29. Since the traffic bridge has important heritage significance, the only grounds for its removal should be on the grounds of serious safety issues and verified by heritage engineers.
30. As long as there is a bridge that I can cross, I don't care about its structure.
31. Replacing timber elements with steel components would destroy the authentic appearance of the bridge.
32. The problem is not the vulnerable structure of the bridge but excessive traffic, which should be reduced.
33. We shouldn't stick to the past when deciding about the future of the bridge, we should be open for modern design options.
34. Whatever works are undertaken, the heritage value of the old bridge will be affected.
35. Altering or replacing the existing Fremantle Bridge means diminishing Fremantle.
36. There are no specific economic benefits for the Fremantle from the bridge.","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
2. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
3. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
4. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
5. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
6. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
7. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
8. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
9. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
10. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
11. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
12. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
13. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
14. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
15. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
16. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
17. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
18. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable

## [Considerations]:
1. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
2. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
3. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
4. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
5. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
6. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
7. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
8. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
9. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
10. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
11. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
12. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
13. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
14. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
15. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
16. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
17. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
18. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
19. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
20. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
21. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
22. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
23. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
24. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
25. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
26. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
27. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
28. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
29. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
30. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
31. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
32. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
33. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
34. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
35. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
36. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
37. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
38. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
39. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
40. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
41. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
42. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.

13. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
14. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
15. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
16. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
17. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
18. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
19. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
20. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
21. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
22. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
23. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries

1. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
2. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
3. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
4. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
5. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
6. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
7. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
8. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
9. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
10. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
11. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
12. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
13. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
14. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
15. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
16. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
17. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
18. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
19. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
20. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
21. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
22. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
23. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
24. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
25. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
26. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
27. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
28. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
29. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
30. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
31. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
32. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
33. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
34. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
35. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
36. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
37. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
38. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
39. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
40. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
41. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
42. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
43. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
2. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
3. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
4. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
5. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
6. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
7. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
8. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
9. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
10. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
11. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
12. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
13. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
14. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
15. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
16. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
17. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
18. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
19. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
20. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
21. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
22. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
23. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
24. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
25. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
26. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
27. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
28. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
29. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
30. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
31. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
32. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
33. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
34. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
35. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
36. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
37. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
38. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
39. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
40. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
41. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
42. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues.

21. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
22. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
23. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
24. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
25. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
26. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
27. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
28. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
29. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
30. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
31. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
32. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
33. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
34. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
35. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
36. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
37. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
38. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
39. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
40. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
41. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
42. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
43. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
2. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
3. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
4. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
5. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
6. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
7. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
8. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
9. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
10. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
11. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
12. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
13. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
14. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
15. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
16. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
17. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
18. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
19.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
20. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
21. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
22. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
23. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
24. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
25. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
26. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
27. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
28. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
29. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
30. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
31. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
32. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
33. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
34. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
35. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
36. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
37. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
38. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
39. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
40. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
41. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
42. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
43. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
44. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.

## [Considerations]:
1. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
2. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
3. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
4. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
5. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
6. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
7. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
8. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
9. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
10. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
11. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
12. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
13. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
14. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
15. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
16. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
17. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
18. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
19. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
20. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
21. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
22. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
23. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
24. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
25.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
26. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
27. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
28. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
29. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
30. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
31. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
32. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
33. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
34. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
35. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
36. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
37. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
38. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
39. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
40. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
41. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
42. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
43. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
44. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
45. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. ","1. 8

5. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
6. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
7. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
8. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
9. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
10. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
11. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
12. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
13. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
14. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
15.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
16. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
17. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
18. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
19. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
20. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
21. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
22. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
23. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
24. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
25. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
26. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
27. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
28. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
29. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
30. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
31. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
32. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
33. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
34. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
35. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
36. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
37. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
38. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
39. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
40. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
41. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
42. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
43. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
44. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
45. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
2. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
3. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
4.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
5. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
6. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
7. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
8. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
9. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
10. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
11. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
12. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
13. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
14. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
15. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
16. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
17. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
18. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
19. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
20. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
21. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
22. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
23. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
24. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
25. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
26. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
27. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
28. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
29. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
30. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
31. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
32. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
33. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
34. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
35. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
36. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
37. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
38. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
39. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
40. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
41. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
42. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
43. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
44. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.

## [Considerations]:
1. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
2. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
3. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
4. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
5. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
6. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
7. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
8. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
9. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
10. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
11. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
12. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
13. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
14. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
15. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
16. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
17. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
18. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
19. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
20. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
21.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
22. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
23. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
24. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
25. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
26. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
27. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
28. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
29. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
30. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
31. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
32. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
33. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
34. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
35. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
36. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
37. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
38. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
39. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
40. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
41. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
42. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
43. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
44. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
45. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.","1. 8

18. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
19. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
20. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
21. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
22. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
23. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
24. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
25. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
26. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
27. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
28. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
29. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
30. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
31. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
32. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
33. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
34. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
35. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
36. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
37. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
38. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
39. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
40. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
41. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
42. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
43. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
44.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
45. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
2. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
3. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
4. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
5. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
6. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
7. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process
8. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
9. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
10. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
11. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.
12. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
13. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
14. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
15. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
16. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
17. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
18. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
19. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
20. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.
21. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.
22. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
23. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
24. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
25. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
26. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
27. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
28. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
29. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
30. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
31. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
32. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
33. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
34. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
35. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
36. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities","1. 11

1. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.

3. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
4. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
5. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.

9. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
10. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
11. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.

13. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
14. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
15. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
16. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
17. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
18. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.

24. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
25. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
26. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.

28. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
29. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
30. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
31. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
32. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete

## [Considerations]:
1. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
2. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
3. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
4. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
5. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
6. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
7. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
8. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
9. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
10. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
11. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
12. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
13. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
14. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
15. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
16. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
17. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
18. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
19. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
20. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
21. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
22. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
23. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
24. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
25. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
26. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
27. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
28. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
29. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
30. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
31. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
32. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
33. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
34. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
35. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
2. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
3. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
4. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
5. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
6. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
7. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
8. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
9. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
10. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
11. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
12. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
13. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
14. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
15. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
16. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
17. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
18. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
19. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
20. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
21. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
22. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
23. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
24. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
25. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
26. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
27. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
28. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
29. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
30. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
31. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
32. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
33. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
34. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

15. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
16. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
17. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
18. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
19. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
20. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
21. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
22. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
23. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
24. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.

28. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
29. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.

## [Considerations]:
1. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
2. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
3. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
4. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
5. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
6. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
7. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
8. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
9. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
10. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
11. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
12. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
13. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
14. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
15. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
16. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
17. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
18. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
19. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
20. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
21. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
22. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
23. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
24. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
25. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
26. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
27. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
28. Genome editing is really cool science.
29. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
30. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
31. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
32. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
33. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
34. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
35. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
36. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
37. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
38. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
39. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
40. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
41. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
42. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
43. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
44. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
45. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.","1. 3

1. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
2. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
3. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
4. Genome editing is really cool science.
5. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
6. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
7. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
8. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
9. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
10. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
11. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
12. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
13. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
14. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
15. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
16. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
17. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
18. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
19. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
20. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
21. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
22. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
23. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
24. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
25. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
26. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
27. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
28. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
29. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
30. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
31. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
32. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
33. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
34. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
35. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
36. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
37. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
38. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
39. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
40. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
41. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
42. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
43. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
44. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.

1. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
2. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
3. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
4. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
5. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
6. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
7. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
8. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
9. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
10. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
11. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
12. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
13. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
14. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
15. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
16. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
17. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
18. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
19. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
20. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
21. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
22. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
23. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
24. Genome editing is really cool science.
25. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
26. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
27. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
28. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
29. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
30. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
31. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
32. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
33. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
34. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
35. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
36. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
37. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
38. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
39. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
40. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
41. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
42. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
43. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
44. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
45. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.","1. 3

3. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
4. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
5. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
6. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
7. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
8. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
9. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
10. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
11. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
12. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
13. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
14. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
15. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
16. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
17. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
18. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
19. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
20. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
21. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
22. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
23. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
24. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
25. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
26. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
27. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
28. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
29. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
30. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
31. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
32. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
33. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
34. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
35. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
36. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
37. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
38. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
39. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
40. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
41. Genome editing is really cool science.
42. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
43. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.

2. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
3. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
4. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
5. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
6. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
7. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
8. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
9. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
10. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
11. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
12. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
13. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
14. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
15. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
16. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
17. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
18. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
19. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
20. Genome editing is really cool science.
21. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
22. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
23. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
24. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
25. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
26. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
27. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
28. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
29. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
30. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
31. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
32. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
33. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
34. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
35. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
36. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
37. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
38. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
39. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
40. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
41. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
42. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
43. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
44. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.

## [Considerations]:
1. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
2. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
3. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
4. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
5. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
6. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
7. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
8. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
9. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
10. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
11. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
12. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
13. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
14. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
15. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
16. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
17. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
18. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
19. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
20. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
21. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
22. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
23. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
24. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
2. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
3. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
4. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
5. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
6. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
7. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
8. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
9. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
10. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
11. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
12. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
13. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
14. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
15. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
16. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
17. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
18. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
19. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
20. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
21. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
22. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
23. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.

## [Considerations]:
1. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
2. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
3. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
4. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
5. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
6. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
7. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
8. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
9. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
10. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
11. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
12. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
13. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
14. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
15. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
16. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
17. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
18. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
19. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
20. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
21. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
22. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
23. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
24. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
2. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
3. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
4. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
5. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
6. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
7. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
8. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
9. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
10. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
11. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
12. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
13. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
14. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
15. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
16. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
17. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
18. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
19. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.

## [Considerations]:
1. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
2. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
3. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
4. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
5. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
6. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
7. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
8. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
9. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
10. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
11. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
12. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
13. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
14. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
15. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
16. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
17. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
18. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
19. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
20. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
21. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
22. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
23. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
24. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.","1. 5

1. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
2. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
3. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
4. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
5. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
6. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
7. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
8. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
9. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
10. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
11. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
12. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
13. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
14. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
15. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
16. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
17. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
18. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
19. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
20. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
21. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
22. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
23. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
24. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
25. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
26. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
27. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
28. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
29. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
30. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
31. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
32. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
33. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
34. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
35. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
36. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
37. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
38. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
39. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
40. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
41. Genetic research will improve our lives.
42. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
43. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
44. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
45. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
46. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
47. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
48. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.

1. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
2. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
3. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
4. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
5. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.

14. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
15. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
16. Genetic research will improve our lives.
17. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
18. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
19. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
20. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
21. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
22. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
23. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
24. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
25. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
26. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
27. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
28. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
29. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
30. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
31. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
32. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
33. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
34. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
35. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
36. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
37. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
38. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
39. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
40. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
41. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
42. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
43. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
