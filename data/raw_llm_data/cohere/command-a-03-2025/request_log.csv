## [Considerations]:
1. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
2. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
3. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
4. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
5. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
6. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
7. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
8. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
9. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
10. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
11. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
12. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
13. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
14. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
15. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
16. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
17. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
18. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
19. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
20. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
21. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
22. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
23. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
24. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
25. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
26. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
27. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
28. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
29. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
30. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
31. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
32. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
33. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
34. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
35. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
36. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
37. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
38. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
39. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
40. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
41. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
42. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
43. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”","1. 7

3. I don't like how development is creeping further and further North into the Daintree and beyond because of its effect on the environment.
4. Native animals in the Daintree need protection because they have a right to life which cannot be traded against economic considerations.
5. I'm not sure if the future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by locals, outsiders or both.
6. Economic development associated with the Bloomfield Track will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.

11. When it comes to the Bloomfield Track, it's not important to worry about what the future will hold
12. The protection of plants and animals in the Daintree is OK so long as it doesn't affect me.
13. The Wujal Wujal Community is better off now that the Bloomfield Track has been built.
14. The more that it is possible for the average North Queensland resident can access the Bloomfield Track the better
15. If future generations could have their say about the Bloomfield track, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
16. The road is just the 'thin edge of the wedge'. This may not happen for a long time, but it will happen.
17. I have no idea what the people in the Bloomfield area think about the Bloomfield Track.
18. If the Bloomfield Track is sealed (bitumenized) there will not be a rapid increase in environmentally damaging development in the Daintree area in the future It may even benefit the environment there.
19. I don't know how, but I think that there must be some way in which everybody benefits from protecting the rainforest near the Bloomfield Track.
20. The Bloomfield Track issue is important for Queensland.
21. Let's fix the problems in the Daintree just for now. The future will take care of itself.
22. I don't know what the people of Bloomfield think about the Bloomfield Track.

24. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track is permanently damaging the coral reefs that fringe the beaches below
25. Laying bitumen on the Bloomfield Track would be beneficial for the environment
26. Conservation in the Daintree area is worthwhile at whatever cost.

28. No development should be permitted in World Heritage areas such as the Daintree.
29. When it comes to the Bloomfield track, people living in Cairns are in no position to judge what the interests of the local residents of Bloomfield are.
30. I don't know if improving the Bloomfield Track would lead to a rapid acceleration of development in the area to the detriment of the environment.
31. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Daintree region because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
32. If we don't take steps to protect the Daintree Rainforest future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the area as we do now.
33. I think that both short and long term perspectives are needed in deciding what should be done with the Bloomfield Track, but I don't know which one is more important.
34. There is no reason to believe that the Daintree Rainforest is under threat.
35. Any decision about the Bloomfield Track will greatly affect people like me.
36. Using cars on the Bloomfield Track is bad for the rainforest.
37. The future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by everyone and not just by those who live in the Bloomfield area.

## [Considerations]:
1. People get the government they deserve
2. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
3. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
4. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
5. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
6. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
7. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
8. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
9. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
10. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
11. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
12. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
13. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
14. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
15. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
16. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
17. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
18. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
19. We live in a great democracy.
20. We are a democratic country.
21. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
22. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
23. I'm always cynical about government processes.
24. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
25. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
26. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
27. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
28. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
29. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
30. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
31. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
32. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
33. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
34. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
35. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
36. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
37. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
38. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
39. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
40. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
41. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
42. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
43. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
44. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
45. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
46. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
47. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
48. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
2. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
3. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
4. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
5. People get the government they deserve
6. I'm always cynical about government processes.
7. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
8. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
9. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
10. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
11. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
12. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
13. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
14. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
15. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
16. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
17. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
18. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
19. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
20. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
21. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
22. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
23. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
24. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
25. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
26. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
27. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
28. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
29. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
30. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
31. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
32. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
33. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
34. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
35. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
36. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
37. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
38. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
39. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
40. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
41. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
42. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
43. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
44. We live in a great democracy.
45. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
46. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
47. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
48. We are a democratic country.","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
2. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
3. We are a democratic country.
4. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
5. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
6. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
7. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
8. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
9. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
10. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
11. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
12. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
13. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
14. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
15. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
16. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
17. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
18. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
19. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
20. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
21. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
22. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
23. I'm always cynical about government processes.
24. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
25. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
26. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
27. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
28. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
29. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
30. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
31. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
32. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
33. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
34. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
35. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
36. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
37. People get the government they deserve
38. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
39. We live in a great democracy.
40. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
41. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
42. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
43. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
44. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
45. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
46. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
47. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
48. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. ","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
2. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
3. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
4. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
5. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
6. I'm always cynical about government processes.
7. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
8. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
9. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
10. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
11. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
12. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
13. We are a democratic country.
14. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
15. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
16. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
17. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
18. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
19. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
20. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
21. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
22. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
23. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
24. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
25. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
26. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
27. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
28. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
29. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
30. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
31. We live in a great democracy.
32. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
33. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
34. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
35. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
36. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
37. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
38. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
39. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
40. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
41. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
42. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
43. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
44. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
45. People get the government they deserve
46. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
47. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
48. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. ","1. 9

9. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
10. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
11. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
12. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
13. People get the government they deserve
14. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
15. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
16. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
17. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
18. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
19. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
20. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
21. We are a democratic country.
22. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
23. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
24. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
25. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
26. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
27. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
28. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
29. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
30. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
31. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
32. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
33. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
34. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
35. I'm always cynical about government processes.
36. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
37. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
38. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
39. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
40. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
41. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
42. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
43. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
44. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
45. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
46. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
47. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.

17. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.

26. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.

42. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
43. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
44. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
45. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
46. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.

28. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
29. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
30. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
31. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
32. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
33. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
34. I'm always cynical about government processes.
35. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
36. We are a democratic country.
37. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
38. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
39. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
40. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
41. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
42. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
43. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.

4. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
5. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
6. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
7. People get the government they deserve
8. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
9. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
10. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
11. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
12. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
13. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
14. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
15. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
16. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
17. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
18. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
19. We live in a great democracy.
20. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
21. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
22. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
23. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.

28. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
29. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
30. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
31. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
32. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
33. We are a democratic country.
34. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
35. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
36. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
37. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
38. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
39. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
40. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
41. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
42. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
43. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
44. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
45. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
46. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market

6. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
7. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
8. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.

10. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
11. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
12. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
13. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
14. I'm always cynical about government processes.
15. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
16. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
17. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
18. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
19. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
20. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.

29. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
30. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
31. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
32. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
33. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
34. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.

36. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
37. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.

39. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
40. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
41. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
42. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.

44. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.

5. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.

13. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
14. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
15. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
16. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
17. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
18. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
19. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
20. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
21. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
22. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.

29. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
30. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.

36. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
37. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
38. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
39. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.

## [Considerations]:
1. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
2. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
3. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
4. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
5. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
6. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
7. We live in a great democracy.
8. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
9. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
10. We are a democratic country.
11. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
12. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
13. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
14. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
15. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
16. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
17. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
18. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
19. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
20. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
21. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
22. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
23. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
24. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
25. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
26. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
27. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
28. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
29. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
30. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
31. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
32. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
33. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
34. I'm always cynical about government processes.
35. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
36. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
37. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
38. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
39. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
40. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
41. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
42. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
43. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
44. People get the government they deserve
45. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
46. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
47. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
48. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.","1. 9

1. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
2. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
3. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
4. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
5. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
6. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
7. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
8. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
9. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
10. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
11. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
12. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
13. I care about the planet.
14. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
15. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
16. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
17. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
18. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
19. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
20. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
21. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
22. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
23. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
2. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
3. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
4. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
5. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
6. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
7. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
8. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
9. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
10. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
11. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
12. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
13. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
14. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
15. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
16. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
17. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
18. I care about the planet.
19. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
20. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
21. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
22. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
23. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
24. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
25. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
26. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
27. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
28. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
29. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
30. We can adapt to the coming changes.
31. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
32. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.

## [Considerations]:
1. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
2. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
3. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
4. We can adapt to the coming changes.
5. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
6. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
7. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
8. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
9. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
10. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
11. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
12. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
13. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
14. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
15. I care about the planet.
16. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
17. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
18. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
19. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
20. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
21. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
22. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
23. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
24. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
25. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
26. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
27. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
28. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
29. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
30. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
31. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
32. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
2. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
3. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
4. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
5. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
6. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
7. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
8. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
9. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
10. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
11. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
12. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
13. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
14. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
15. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
16. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
17. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
18. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
19. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
20. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
21. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
22. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
23. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
24. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
25. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
26. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
27. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
28. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
29. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
30. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
31. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
32. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
33. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
34. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
35. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
36. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
37. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
38. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
39. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
40. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
41. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
42. Forest health means jobs.
43. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
44. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
45. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. ","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
2. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
3. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
4. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
5. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
6. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
7. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
8. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
9. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
10. Forest health means jobs.
11. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
12. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
13. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
14. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
15. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
16. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
17. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
18. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
19. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
20. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
21. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
22. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
23. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
24. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
25. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
26. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
27. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
28. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
29. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
30. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
31. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
32. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
33. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
34. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
35. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
36. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
37. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
38. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
39. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
40. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
41. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
42. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
43. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
44. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
45. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. ","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
2. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
3. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
4. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
5. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
6. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
7. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
8. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
9. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
10. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
11. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
12. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
13. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
14. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
15. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
16. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
17. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
18. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
19. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
20. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
21. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
22. Forest health means jobs.
23. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
24. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
25. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
26. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
27. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
28. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
29. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
30. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
31. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
32. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
33. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
34. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
35. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
36. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
37. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
38. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
39. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
40. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
41. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
42. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
43. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
44. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
45. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.","1. 8

7. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
8. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
9. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
10. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
11. Forest health means jobs.
12. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
13. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
14. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
15. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
16. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
17. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
18. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
19. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.

23. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
24. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
25. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
26. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
27. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
28. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
29. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
30. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
31. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
32. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
33. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
34. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.

36. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
37. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
38. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
39. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.

## [Considerations]:
1. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
2. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
3. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
4. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
5. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
6. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
7. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
8. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
9. Forest health means jobs.
10. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
11. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
12. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
13. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
14. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
15. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
16. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
17. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
18. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
19. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
20. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
21. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
22. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
23. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
24. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
25. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
26. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
27. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
28. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
29. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
30. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
31. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
32. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
33. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
34. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
35. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
36. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
37. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
38. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
39. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
40. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
41. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
42. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
43. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
44. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
45. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. ","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. Forest health means jobs.
2. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
3. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
4. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
5. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
6. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
7. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
8. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
9. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
10. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
11. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
12. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
13. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
14. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
15. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
16. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
17. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
18. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
19. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
20. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
21. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
22. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
23. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
24. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
25. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
26. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
27. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
28. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
29. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
30. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
31. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
32. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
33. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
34. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
35. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
36. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
37. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
38. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
39. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
40. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
41. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
42. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
43. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
44. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
45. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. ","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
2. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
3. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
4. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
5. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
6. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
7. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
8. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
9. Forest health means jobs.
10. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
11. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
12. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
13. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
14. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
15. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
16. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
17. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
18. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
19. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
20. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
21. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
22. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
23. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
24. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
25. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
26. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
27. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
28. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
29. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
30. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
31. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
32. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
33. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
34. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
35. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
36. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
37. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
38. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
39. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
40. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
41. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
42. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
43. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
44. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
45. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.","1. 9

28. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
29. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
30. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.

40. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
41. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
42. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
43. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
44. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
45. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.","1. 11

## [Considerations]:
1. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.  
2. The priority for healthcare should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
3. Genetic research will improve our lives.
4. It is always permissible to do research on my personally identifiable sample without my prior permission.  
5. There is no point in consulting the public about ethical issues in science and technology.
6. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies.
7. Educating people about health issues (e.g. diet and lifestyle changes) promises greater health effects than investing in biobanks.
8. Scientists should have access to all unidentified, personal samples for research.
9. Genetic studies of race on enthocultural communities will lead to the discrimination of those same enthocultural communities. 
10. I trust researchers to control access to my personal samples.
11. Participants should be contacted every time researchers want to use their samples for research.
12. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
13. Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.
14. I do not care if my donated sample is connected to my name and medical information.
15. Biobanks will only lead to expensive treatments and high profits. 
16. Researchers should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.  
17. I should have property rights to my tissues before or after they leave my body.
18. Participants should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at anytime. 
19. Aboriginal communities require special consideration concerning healthcare and research.
20. Policy makers should consider the possibility that Canada should not pursue biobanking.
21. Genetic information is different from health information. 
22. Participants who donate their samples for research should be given special access to the treatments and therapies that result from that research. 
23. Genetic studies of disability will lead to the discrimination of people living with the same conditions.
24. My personal sample should never be anonymized since I should be informed of important research results.  
25. Sampling some people in an ethnocultural community is acceptable only if the whole ethnocultural community has agreed to participate.
26. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for bothers me. 
27. Everyone should donate samples to a biobank for the benefit of everyone. 
28. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government. 
29. Participants should be active in the set up and oversight of  biobanks. 
30. The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  
31. Biobanks need independent review boards to determine who should have access to samples. 
32. There is no risk to the participants who donate to biobanks.
33. If someone is a carrier of a genetic disease, they have a responsibility to participate in genetic research.
34. To me, religious communities need to be consulted about genetic and biobank research. 
35. Profits from biobanking should be returned to the donating community. 
36. All participants should be paid for donating their samples to a biobank. 
37. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health.
38. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.","1. 9

2. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
3. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).

7. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
8. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
9. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
10. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
11. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
12. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
13. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
14. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
15. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
16. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
17. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
18. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
19. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
20. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
21. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
22. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
23. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
24. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
25. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
26. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
27. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
28. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
29. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.

## [Considerations]:
1. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
2. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
3. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
4. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
5. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
6. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
7. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
8. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
9. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
10. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
11. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
12. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
13. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
14. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
15. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
16. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
17. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
18. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
19. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
20. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
21. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
22. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
23. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
24. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
25. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
26. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
27. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
28. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
29. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
30. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.

1. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
2. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
3. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
4. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
5. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
6. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
7. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
8. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
9. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
10. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
11. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
12. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
13. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
14. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
15. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
16. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
17. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
18. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
19. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
20. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
21. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
22. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
23. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
24. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
25. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
26. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
27. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
28. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
29. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
30. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.

1. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
2. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
3. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
4. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
5. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
6. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
7. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
8. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
9. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
10. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
11. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
12. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
13. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
14. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
15. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
16. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
17. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
18. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
19. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
20. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.

22. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
23. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
24. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
25. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
26. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
27. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
2. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
3. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
4. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
5. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
6. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
7. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
8. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
9. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
10. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
11. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
12. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
13. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
14. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
15. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
16. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
17. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
18. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
19. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
20. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
21. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
22. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
23. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
24. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
25. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
26. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
27. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
28. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
29. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.

13. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
14. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
15. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
16. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
17. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
18. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
2. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
3. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
4. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
5. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
6. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
7. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
8. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
9. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
10. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
11. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
12. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
13. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
14. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
15. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
16. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
17. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
18. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
19. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
20. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
21. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
22. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
23. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
24. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
25. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
26. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
27. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
28. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
29. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
30. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
31. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.","1. 7

3. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
4. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
5. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
6. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
7. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
8. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
9. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
10. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
11. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
12. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
13. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
14. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
15. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
16. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
17. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
18. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
19. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
20. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.

1. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
2. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
3. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
4. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
5. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
6. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
7. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
8. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
9. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
10. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
11. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
12. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
13. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
14. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
15. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
16. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
17. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
18. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
19. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
20. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
21. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
22. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
23. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
24. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
25. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
26. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
27. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
28. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
29. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.

## [Considerations]:
1. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
2. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
3. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
4. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
5. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
6. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
7. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
8. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
9. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
10. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
11. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
12. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
13. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
14. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
15. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
16. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
17. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
18. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
19. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
20. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
21. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
22. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
23. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
24. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
25. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
26. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
27. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
28. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
29. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
2. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
3. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
4. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
5. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
6. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
7. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
8. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
9. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
10. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
11. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
12. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
13. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
14. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
15. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
16. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
17. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
18. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
19. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
20. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
21. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
22. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
23. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
24. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
25. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
26. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
27. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
28. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.

1. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
2. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
3. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
4. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
5. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
6. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
7. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
8. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
9. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
10. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
11. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
12. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
13. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
14. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
15. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
16. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
17. Food waste is a major environmental issue
18. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
19. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
20. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
21. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
22. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
23. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
24. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
25. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
26. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
27. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
28. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
29. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products

5. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
6. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
7. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
8. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
9. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
10. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture

14. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
15. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
16. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
17. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
18. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
19. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
20. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled

## [Considerations]:
1. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
2. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
3. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
4. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
5. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
6. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
7. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
8. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
9. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
10. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
11. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
12. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
13. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
14. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
15. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
16. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
17. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
18. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
19. Food waste is a major environmental issue
20. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
21. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
22. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
23. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
24. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
25. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
26. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
27. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
28. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic

## [Considerations]:
1. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
2. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
3. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
4. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
5. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
6. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
7. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
8. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
9. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
10. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
11. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
12. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
13. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
14. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
15. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
16. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
17. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
18. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
19. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
20. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
21. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
22. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
23. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
24. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
25. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
26. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
27. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
28. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
29. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them

## [Considerations]:
1. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
2. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
3. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
4. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
5. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
6. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
7. Food waste is a major environmental issue
8. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
9. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
10. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
11. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
12. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
13. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
14. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
15. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
16. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
17. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
18. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
19. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
20. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
21. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
22. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
23. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
24. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
25. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
26. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
27. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
28. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
29. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products

3. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
4. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
5. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
6. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
7. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
8. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
9. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
10. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
11. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
12. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
13. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
14. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
15. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
16. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
17. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
18. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
19. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
20. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
21. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
22. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
23. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
24. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
25. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
26. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
27. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
28. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
29. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
30. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.

2. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
3. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
4. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
5. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
6. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
7. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
8. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
9. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
10. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
11. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
12. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
13. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
14. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
15. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
16. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
17. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
18. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
19. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
20. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
21. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
22. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
23. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
24. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
25. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
26. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
27. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
28. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
29. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
30. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.

## [Considerations]:
1. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
2. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
3. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
4. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
5. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
6. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
7. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
8. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
9. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
10. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
11. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
12. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
13. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
14. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
15. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
16. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
17. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
18. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
19. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
20. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
21. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
22. It is certain to say that climate change exists.

1. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
2. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
3. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
4. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
5. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
6. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
7. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
8. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
9. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
10. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
11. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
12. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
13. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
14. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
15. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
16. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
17. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
18. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
19. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
20. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
21. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
22. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
23. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
24. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
25. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
26. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
27. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
28. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
29. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
30. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.

## [Considerations]:
1. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
2. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
3. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
4. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
5. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
6. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
7. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
8. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
9. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
10. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
11. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
12. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
13. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
14. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
15. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
16. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
17. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
18. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
19. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
20. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
21. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
22. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
23. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
24. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
25. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
26. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
27. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
28. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
29. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
30. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
31. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.

## [Considerations]:
1. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
2. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
3. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
4. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
5. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
6. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
7. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
8. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
9. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
10. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
11. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
12. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
13. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
14. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
15. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
16. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
17. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
18. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
19. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
20. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
21. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
22. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
23. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
24. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
25. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
26. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
27. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
28. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
29. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
30. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
31. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.

1. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
2. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
3. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
4. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
5. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
6. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
7. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
8. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
9. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
10. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
11. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
12. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
13. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
14. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
15. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
16. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
17. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
18. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
19. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
20. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
21. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
22. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
23. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
24. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.

1. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
2. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
3. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
4. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
5. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
6. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
7. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
8. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
9. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
10. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
11. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
12. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
13. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
14. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
15. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
16. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
17. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
18. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
19. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
20. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
21. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
22. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
23. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
24. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
25. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
26. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
27. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
28. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
29. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
30. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
31. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.

3. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
4. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
5. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
6. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
7. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
8. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
9. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
10. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
11. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
12. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
13. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
14. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
15. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
16. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
17. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
18. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
19. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
20. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
21. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
22. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
23. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
24. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
25. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
26. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
27. It is certain that climate change exists.
28. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
29. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
30. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
31. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
32. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
2. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
3. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
4. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
5. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
6. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
7. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
8. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
9. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
10. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
11. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
12. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
13. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
14. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
15. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
16. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
17. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
18. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
19. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
20. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
21. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
22. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
23. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
24. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
25. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
26. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
27. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
28. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
29. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
30. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
31. It is certain that climate change exists.
32. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.

1. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
2. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
3. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
4. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
5. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
6. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
7. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
8. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
9. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
10. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
11. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
12. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
13. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
14. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
15. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
16. It is certain that climate change exists.
17. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
18. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
19. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
20. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
21. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.

23. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
24. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
25. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
26. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
27. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
28. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
29. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
30. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
31. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.

## [Considerations]:
1. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
2. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
3. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
4. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
5. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
6. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
7. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
8. It is certain that climate change exists.
9. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
10. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
11. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
12. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
13. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
14. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
15. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
16. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
17. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
18. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
19. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
20. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
21. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
22. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
23. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
24. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
25. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
26. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
27. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
28. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
29. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
30. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
31. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
32. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.

1. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
2. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
3. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
4. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
5. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
6. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
7. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
8. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
9. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
10. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
11. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
12. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
13. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
14. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
15. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
16. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.

## [Considerations]:
1. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
2. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
3. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
4. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
5. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
6. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
7. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
8. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
9. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
10. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
11. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
12. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
13. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
14. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
15. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
16. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
17. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
18. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
19. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
20. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.","1. 1

6. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
7. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
8. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
9. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
10. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
11. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
12. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
13. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
14. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
15. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
16. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
17. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
18. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
19. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
20. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
21. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
22. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
23. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
24. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
25. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
26. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
27. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
28. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
29. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
30. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
31. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
32. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
33. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
34. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
35. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
36. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
37. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
38. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
39. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
40. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
41. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.

1. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
2. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
3. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
4. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
5. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
6. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
7. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
8. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
9. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
10. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
11. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
12. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
13. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
14. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
15. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
16. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
17. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
18. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
19. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
20. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
21. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
22. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
23. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.

27. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
28. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
29. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
30. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
31. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
32. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
33. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
34. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
35. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
36. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
37. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
38. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.

## [Considerations]:
1. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
2. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
3. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
4. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
5. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
6. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
7. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
8. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
9. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
10. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
11. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
12. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
13. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
14. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
15. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
16. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
17. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
18. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
19. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
20. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
21. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
22. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
23. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
24. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
25. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
26. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
27. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
28. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
29. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
30. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
31. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
32. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
33. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
34. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
35. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
36. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
37. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
38. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
39. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
40. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
41. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
42. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”

## [Considerations]:
1. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
2. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
3. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
4. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
5. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
6. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
7. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
8. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
9. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
10. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
11. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
12. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
13. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
14. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
15. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
16. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
17. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
18. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
19. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
20. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
21. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
22. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
23. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
24. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
25. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
26. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
27. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
28. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
29. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
30. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
31. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
32. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
33. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
34. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
35. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
36. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
37. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
38. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
39. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
40. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
41. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy

## [Considerations]:
1. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
2. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
3. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
4. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
5. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
6. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
7. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
8. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
9. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
10. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
11. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
12. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
13. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
14. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
15. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
16. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
17. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
18. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
19. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
20. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
21. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
22. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
23. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
24. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
25. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
26. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
27. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
28. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
29. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
30. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
31. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
32. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
33. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
34. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
35. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
36. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
37. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
38. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
39. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
40. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
41. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
42. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature

## [Considerations]:
1. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
2. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
3. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
4. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
5. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
6. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
7. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
8. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
9. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
10. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
11. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
12. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
13. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
14. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
15. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
16. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
17. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
18. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
19. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
20. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
21. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
22. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
23. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
24. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
25. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
26. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
27. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
28. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
29. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
30. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
31. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
32. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
33. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
34. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
35. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
36. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
37. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
38. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
39. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
40. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
41. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
42. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
43. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
2. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
3. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
4. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
5. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
6. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
7. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
8. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
9. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
10. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
11. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
12. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
13. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
14. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
15. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
16. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
17.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
18. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
19. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
20. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
21. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
22. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
23. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
24. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
25. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
26. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
27. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
28. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
29. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
30. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
31. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
32. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
33. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
34. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
35. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
36. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
37. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
38. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
39. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
40. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
41. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
42. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
43. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
44. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
45. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
2. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
3. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
4. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
5. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
6. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
7. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
8. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
9. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
10. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
11. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
12. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
13. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
14. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
15. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
16. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
17. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
18. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
19. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
20. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
21. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
22. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
23. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
24. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
25. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
26. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
27. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
28. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
29. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
30. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
31. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
32. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
33. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
34. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
35. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
36. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
37. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
38. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
39. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
40. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
41.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
42. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
43. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
44. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
45. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
2. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
3. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
4. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
5. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
6. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
7. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
8.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
9. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
10. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
11. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
12. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
13. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
14. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
15. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
16. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
17. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
18. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
19. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
20. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
21. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
22. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
23. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
24. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
25. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
26. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
27. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
28. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
29. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
30. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
31. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
32. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
33. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
34. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
35. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
36. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
37. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
38. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
39. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
40. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
41. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
42. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
43. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
44. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
45. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.","1. 9

16. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
17. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
18. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
19. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
20. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
21. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
22. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
23. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
24. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
25. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
26. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
27. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
28. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
29. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
30.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
31. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
32. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
33. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
34. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
35. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
36. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
37. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
38. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
39. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
40. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
41. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
42. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
43. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
44. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
45. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
2. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
3. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
4. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
5. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
6. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
7. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
8. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
9. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
10.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
11. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
12. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
13. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
14. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
15. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
16. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
17. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
18. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
19. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
20. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
21. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
22. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
23. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
24. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
25. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
26. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
27. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
28. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
29. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
30. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
31. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
32. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
33. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
34. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
35. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
36. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
37. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
38. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
39. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
40. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
41. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
42. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
43. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
44. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).

## [Considerations]:
1. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
2. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
3. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
4. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
5. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
6. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
7. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
8.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
9. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
10. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
11. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
12. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
13. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
14. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
15. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
16. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
17. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
18. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
19. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
20. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
21. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
22. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
23. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
24. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
25. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
26. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
27. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
28. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
29. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
30. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
31. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
32. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
33. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
34. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
35. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
36. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
37. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
38. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
39. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
40. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
41. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
42. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
43. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
44. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
45. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
2. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
3. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
4. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
5. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
6. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
7. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
8. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
9. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
10. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
11. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
12. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
13. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
14. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
15. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
16. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
17.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
18. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
19. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
20. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
21. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
22. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
23. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
24. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
25. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
26. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
27. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
28. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
29. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
30. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
31. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
32. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
33. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
34. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
35. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
36. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
37. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
38. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
39. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
40. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
41. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
42. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
43. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
44. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
45. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
2. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
3. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
4. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
5. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
6. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
7. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
8. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
9. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
10. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
11. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
12. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
13. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
14. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
15. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
16.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
17. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
18. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
19. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
20. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
21. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
22. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
23. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
24. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
25. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
26. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
27. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
28. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
29. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
30. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
31. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
32. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
33. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
34. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
35. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
36. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
37. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
38. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
39. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
40. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
41. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
42. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
43. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
44. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
45. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.","1. 4

14. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
15. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
16. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
17. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
18.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
19. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
20. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
21. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
22. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
23. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
24. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
25. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
26. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
27. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
28. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
29. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
30. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
31. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
32. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
33. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
34. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
35. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
36. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
37. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
38. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
39. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
40. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
41. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
42. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
43. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
44. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
45. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.","1. 3

32. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
33. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
34. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
35. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
36. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
37. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
38. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
39. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
40. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
41. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
42. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
43. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
44. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
45. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
2. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
3. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
4. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
5. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
6. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
7. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
8. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
9. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
10. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
11. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
12. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
13. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
14. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
15. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
16. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
17. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
18. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
19. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
20. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
21. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
22. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
23. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
24. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
25. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
26. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
27. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
28. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
29. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
30. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
31. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
32. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
33. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
34. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
35. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
36.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
37. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
38. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
39. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
40. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
41. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
42. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
43. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
44. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
45. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.","1. 9

5. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
6. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
7. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
8. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
9. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
10. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
11. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
12. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.
13. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
14. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
15. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
16. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
17. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
18. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
19. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
20. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
21. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
22. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
23. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
24. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
25. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
26. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
27. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.

1. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
2. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
3. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
4. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
5. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
6. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
7. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
8. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
9. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
10. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
11. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
12. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.
13. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
14. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
15. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
16. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
17. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
18. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
19. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
20. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities
21. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
22. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
23. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
24. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
25. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
26. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.
27. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.
28. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
29. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
30. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
31. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
32. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing

## [Considerations]:
1. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
2. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
3. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
4. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
5. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
6. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
7. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
8. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
9. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
10. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
11. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
12. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
13. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
14. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
15. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
16. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
17. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
18. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
19. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
20. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
21. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
22. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
23. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
24. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
25. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
26. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
27. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
28. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
29. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
30. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
31. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
32. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
33. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
34. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
35. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. ","1. 3

2. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
3. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
4. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
5. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
6. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
7. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
8. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
9. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
10. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
11. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
12. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
13. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
14. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
15. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
16. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
17. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
18. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
19. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
20. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
21. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
22. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
23. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
24. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
25. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
26. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
27. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
28. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
29. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
30. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
31. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
32. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
33. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
34. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
35. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
2. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
3. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
4. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
5. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
6. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
7. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
8. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
9. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
10. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
11. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
12. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
13. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
14. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
15. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
16. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
17. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
18. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
19. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
20. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
21. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
22. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
23. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
24. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
25. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
26. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
27. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
28. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
29. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
30. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
31. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
32. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
33. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
34. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
35. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
2. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
3. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
4. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
5. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
6. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
7. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
8. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
9. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
10. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
11. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
12. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
13. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
14. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
15. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
16. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
17. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
18. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
19. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
20. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
21. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
22. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
23. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
24. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
25. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
26. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
27. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
28. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
29. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
30. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
31. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
32. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
33. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
34. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.

1. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
2. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
3. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
4. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
5. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
6. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
7. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
8. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
9. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
10. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
11. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
12. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
13. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
14. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
15. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
16. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
17. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
18. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
19. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
20. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
21. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
22. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
23. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
24. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
25. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
26. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
27. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
28. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
29. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
30. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
31. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
32. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.

1. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
2. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
3. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
4. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
5. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
6. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
7. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
8. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
9. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
10. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
11. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
12. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
13. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
14. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
15. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
16. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
17. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
18. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
19. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
20. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
21. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
22. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
23. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
24. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
25. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
26. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
27. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
28. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.

## [Considerations]:
1. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
2. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
3. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
4. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
5. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
6. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
7. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
8. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
9. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
10. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
11. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
12. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
13. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
14. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
15. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
16. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
17. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
18. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
19. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
20. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
21. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
22. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
23. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
24. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
25. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
26. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
27. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
28. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
29. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
30. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
31. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
32. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
33. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
34. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
35. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. ","1. 7

1. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
2. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
3. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
4. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
5. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
6. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
7. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
8. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
9. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
10. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
11. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
12. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
13. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
14. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
15. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
16. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
17. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
18. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
19. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
20. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
21. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
22. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
23. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
24. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
25. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
26. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
27. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
28. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
29. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
30. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
31. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
32. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
33. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.

38. Genome editing is really cool science.
39. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
40. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
41. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
42. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet.

## [Considerations]:
1. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
2. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
3. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
4. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
5. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
6. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
7. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
8. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
9. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
10. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
11. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
12. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
13. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
14. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
15. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
16. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
17. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
18. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
19. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
20. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
21. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
22. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
23. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
24. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
25. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
26. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
27. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
28. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
29. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
30. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
31. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
32. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
33. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
34. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
35. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
36. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
37. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
38. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
39. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
40. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
41. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
42. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
43. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.

3. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
4. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
5. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
6. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
7. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
8. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
9. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
10. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
11. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
12. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
13. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
14. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
15. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
16. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
17. Genome editing is really cool science.
18. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
19. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
20. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
21. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
22. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
23. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
24. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
25. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
26. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
27. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
28. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
29. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
30. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
31. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
32. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
33. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
34. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
35. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
36. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
37. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
38. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
39. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
40. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
41. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
42. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.

## [Considerations]:
1. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
2. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
3. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
4. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
5. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
6. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
7. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
8. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
9. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
10. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
11. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
12. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
13. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
14. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
15. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
16. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
17. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
18. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
19. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
20. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
21. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
22. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
23. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
24. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
25. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
26. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
27. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
28. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
29. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
30. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
31. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
32. Genome editing is really cool science.
33. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
34. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
35. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
36. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
37. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
38. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
39. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
40. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
41. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
42. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
43. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
44. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.

## [Considerations]:
1. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
2. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
3. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
4. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
5. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
6. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
7. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
8. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
9. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
10. Genome editing is really cool science.
11. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
12. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
13. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
14. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
15. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
16. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
17. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
18. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
19. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
20. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
21. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
22. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
23. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
24. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
25. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
26. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
27. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
28. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
29. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
30. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
31. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
32. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
33. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
34. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
35. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
36. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
37. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
38. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
39. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
40. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
41. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
42. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
43. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
44. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.

## [Considerations]:
1. Genome editing is really cool science.
2. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
3. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
4. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
5. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
6. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
7. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
8. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
9. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
10. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
11. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
12. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
13. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
14. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
15. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
16. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
17. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
18. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
19. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
20. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
21. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
22. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
23. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
24. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
25. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
26. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
27. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
28. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
29. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
30. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
31. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
32. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
33. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
34. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
35. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
36. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
37. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
38. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
39. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
40. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
41. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.

1. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
2. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
3. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
4. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
5. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
6. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
7. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
8. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
9. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
10. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
11. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
12. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
13. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
14. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
15. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
16. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
17. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
18. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
19. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
20. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
21. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
22. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
23. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.

## [Considerations]:
1. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
2. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
3. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
4. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
5. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
6. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
7. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
8. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
9. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
10. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
11. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
12. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
13. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
14. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
15. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
16. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
17. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
18. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
19. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
20. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
21. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
22. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
23. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
24. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.","1. 5

24. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
25. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
26. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
27. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
28. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.

30. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
31. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
32. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
33. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.

3. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
4. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
5. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
6. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
7. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
8. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
9. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
10. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
11. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
12. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
13. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
14. Genetic research will improve our lives.
15. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
16. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
17. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
18. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.

20. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
21. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
22. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
23. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
24. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
25. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results

27. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
28. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
29. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
30. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
31. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
32. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
33. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.

41. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
42. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
43. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
44. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
45. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
46. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples

## [Considerations]:
1. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
2. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
3. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
4. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
5. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
6. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
7. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
8. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
9. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
10. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
11. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
12. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
13. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
14. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
15. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
16. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
17. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
18. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
19. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
20. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
21. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
22. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
23. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
24. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
25. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
26. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
27. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
28. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
29. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
30. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
31. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
32. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
33. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
34. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
35. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
36. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
37. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
38. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
39. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
40. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
41. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
42. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
43. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
44. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
45. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
46. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
47. Genetic research will improve our lives.
48. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
49. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.","1. 5
