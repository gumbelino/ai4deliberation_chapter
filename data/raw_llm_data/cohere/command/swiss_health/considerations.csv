cuid,created_at,provider,model,temperature,input_tokens,output_tokens,"C1. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.",C2. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.,C3. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.,"C4. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.",C5. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.,C6. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.,C7. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.,"C8. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.","C9. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.",C10. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.,C11. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.,C12. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.,C13. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.,"C14. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.",C15. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.,C16. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.,C17. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.,"C18. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.",C19. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.,C20. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.,"C21. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.",C22. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.,"C23. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.",C24. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
