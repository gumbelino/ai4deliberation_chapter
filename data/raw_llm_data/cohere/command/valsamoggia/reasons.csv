While some municipalities may struggle at first, the benefits of the amalgamation will eventually win out. This is a good proposal and deserves support."

I ranked Policy 1 as least supported because it is the only option which directly opposes the amalgamation, making it the least preferred choice. Policy 4 is ranked as most supported, since it supports the proposed amalgamation, the initiative with the most positive considerations."

I support the idea of amalgamation, but also feel that the process should be more transparent and democratic, with more plans and strategies in place before moving forward."

It is not the only solution, and the union itself was not given enough time to prove itself. The fusion is a big step towards a more centralized power and administration."

The most supportive response argues that the fusion will bring the needs of the citizens and the territory closer, while the least supportive focuses on the unknown risks of the fusion and the lack of a clear project or strategy."

While I understand the desire to innovate and the potential advantages of a more unified administrative process, I have reservations about the lack of clarity and comprehensive planning surrounding these proposals."

There are many uncertainties and the process is a little chaotic, so it is not clear to me whether it will improve things, and hopefully, the negative aspects of this process will not outweigh the positive aspects."

As there are currently limits to the union, it may be beneficial to explore a more gradual shift towards consolidation, which could help mitigate the unknowns and risks associated with a larger fusion."

Indeed, the needs of the territory are diverse and may require a more tailored approach â€” a single, unified municipality may be able to address these effectively, but its decisions may also be far removed from the interests of smaller towns and localities within Valsamoggia."

A more gradual approach with clear goals and plans will be less disruptive and more likely to maintain local control and accountability, while more time is given to addressing the unique needs of the smaller municipalities."

The Q methodology results suggest a divided perception of the population with respect to the amalgamation of the five municipalities.

Though there are positive elements in each option, I favour options that minimize risk and disruption. I thus rank options 1 and 4, which would halt or delay the amalgamation, the highest. Option 2, which would enhance the union's powers, is my least preferred, as it seems to repeat a failed approach."
