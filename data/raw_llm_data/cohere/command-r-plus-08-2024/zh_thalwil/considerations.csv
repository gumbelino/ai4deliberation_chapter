It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.,C4. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.,C5. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.,C6. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.,C7. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.,"C8. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.","C9. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.",C10. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.,C11. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.,C12. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.,C13. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.,C14. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.,C15. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.,"C16. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).",C17. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.,"C18. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.",C19. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.,C20. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.,C21. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.,C22. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.,C23. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.,C24. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.,"C25. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.",C26. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.,"C27. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.",C28. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.,C29. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.,C30. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.,"C31. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change."
