## [Considerations]:
1. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
2. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
3. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
4. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
5. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
6. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
7. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
8. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
9. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
10. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
11. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
12. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
13. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
14. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
15. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
16. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
17. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
18. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
19. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
20. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
21. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
22. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
23. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
24. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
25. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
26. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
27. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
28. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
29. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
30. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
31. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
32. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
33. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
34. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
35. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
36. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
37. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
38. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
39. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
40. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
41. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
42. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
43. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. When it comes to the Bloomfield Track, it's not important to worry about what the future will hold
2. A long term perspective on the Bloomfield Track is essential.
3. In deciding on what to do with the Bloomfield Track I don't know whether it's more important to meet the needs of the community or the environment.
4. Using cars on the Bloomfield Track is bad for the rainforest.
5. No development should be permitted in World Heritage areas such as the Daintree.
6. The coral reefs along the foreshore below the Bloomfield Track are not badly affected by the road.
7. Whilst impacts on locals in the Bloomfield area are a concern, it is the broader community that should carry more weight when deciding what to do with the Bloomfield Track.
8. I would be worse off if more of the Daintree rainforest is protected.
9. If the Bloomfield Track is sealed (bitumenized) there will not be a rapid increase in environmentally damaging development in the Daintree area in the future It may even benefit the environment there.
10. The Bloomfield Track may not have been the best idea, but I guess there is probably little point in closing it now that it has been built.
11. I'm not sure if the future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by locals, outsiders or both.
12. Everyone in Queensland is better off for having a road like the Bloomfield Track.
13. The road is just the 'thin edge of the wedge'. This may not happen for a long time, but it will happen.
14. Conservation in the Daintree area is worthwhile at whatever cost.
15. When it comes to the Bloomfield track, people living in Cairns are in no position to judge what the interests of the local residents of Bloomfield are.
16. Any decision about the Bloomfield Track will greatly affect people like me.
17. I have no idea what the people in the Bloomfield area think about the Bloomfield Track.
18. The Bloomfield Track issue is important for Queensland.
19. The future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by everyone and not just by those who live in the Bloomfield area.
20. I don't know if improving the Bloomfield Track would lead to a rapid acceleration of development in the area to the detriment of the environment.
21. The fate of the Bloomfield Track is of no concern to me.
22. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track is permanently damaging the coral reefs that fringe the beaches below
23. The Wujal Wujal Community is better off now that the Bloomfield Track has been built.
24. Let's fix the problems in the Daintree just for now. The future will take care of itself.
25. I don't know what the people of Bloomfield think about the Bloomfield Track.
26. I don't like how development is creeping further and further North into the Daintree and beyond because of its effect on the environment.
27. I don't know how, but I think that there must be some way in which everybody benefits from protecting the rainforest near the Bloomfield Track.
28. If we don't take steps to protect the Daintree Rainforest future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the area as we do now.
29. If future generations could have their say about the Bloomfield track, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
30. The protection of plants and animals in the Daintree is OK so long as it doesn't affect me.
31. I don't really know who benefits most from the protection of Rainforest in the Daintree.
32. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Daintree region because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
33. Laying bitumen on the Bloomfield Track would be beneficial for the environment
34. The Bloomfield Track is important because it allows quick access to remote areas of the North.
35. The more that it is possible for the average North Queensland resident can access the Bloomfield Track the better
36. I think that both short and long term perspectives are needed in deciding what should be done with the Bloomfield Track, but I don't know which one is more important.
37. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track does not cause siltation or damage to the fringing inshore reefs between Cape Tribulation and Cooktown
38. Native animals in the Daintree need protection because they have a right to life which cannot be traded against economic considerations.
39. There is no reason to believe that the Daintree Rainforest is under threat.
40. Economic development associated with the Bloomfield Track will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
41. I'm concerned that I will be made worse off by any decision about the Bloomfield Track.
42. The most important use of the Bloomfield Track is for tourism.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
2. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
3. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
4. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
5. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
6. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
7. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
8. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
9. We can adapt to the coming changes.
10. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
11. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
12. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
13. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
14. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
15. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
16. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
17. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
18. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
19. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
20. I care about the planet.
21. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
22. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
23. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
24. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
25. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
26. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
27. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
28. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
29. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
30. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
31. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
32. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
33. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.","1. 8
