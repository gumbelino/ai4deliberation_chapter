## [Considerations]:
1. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
2. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
3. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
4. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
5. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
6. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
7. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
8. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
9. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
10. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
11. People get the government they deserve
12. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
13. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
14. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
15. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
16. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
17. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
18. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
19. I'm always cynical about government processes.
20. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
21. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
22. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
23. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
24. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
25. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
26. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
27. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
28. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
29. We live in a great democracy.
30. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
31. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
32. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
33. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
34. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
35. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
36. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
37. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
38. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
39. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
40. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
41. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
42. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
43. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
44. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
45. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
46. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
47. We are a democratic country.
48. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.","1. 8

1. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
2. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries.

4. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
5. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
6. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
7. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
8. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
9. We can adapt to the coming changes.
10. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
11. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
12. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
13. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
14. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
15. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
16. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
17. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
18. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
19. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
20. I care about the planet.
21. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
22. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
23. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
24. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
25. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
26. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
27. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
28. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
29. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
30. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
31. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.

28. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
29. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
30. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
31. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
32. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
2. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
3. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
4. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
5. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
6. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
7. Forest health means jobs.
8. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
9. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
10. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
11. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
12. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
13. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
14. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
15. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
16. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
17. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
18. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
19. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
20. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
21. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
22. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
23. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
24. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
25. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
26. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
27. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
28. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
29. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
30. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
31. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
32. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
33. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
34. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
35. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
36. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
37. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
38. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
39. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
40. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
41. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
42. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
43. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
44. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
45. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.","1. 3

5. Genetic studies of disability will lead to the discrimination of people living with the same conditions.
6. My personal sample should never be anonymized since I should be informed of important research results.  
7. Biobanks will only lead to expensive treatments and high profits. 
8. Genetic information is different from health information. 
9. There is no point in consulting the public about ethical issues in science and technology.

14. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.  
15. Genetic research will improve our lives.
16. Sampling some people in an ethnocultural community is acceptable only if the whole ethnocultural community has agreed to participate.
17. All participants should be paid for donating their samples to a biobank. 
18. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health.
19. Researchers should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.  
20. Participants should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at anytime. 
21. Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.
22. Participants should be active in the set up and oversight of  biobanks. 
23. To me, religious communities need to be consulted about genetic and biobank research. 
24. If someone is a carrier of a genetic disease, they have a responsibility to participate in genetic research.
25. Biobanks need independent review boards to determine who should have access to samples. 
26. Participants who donate their samples for research should be given special access to the treatments and therapies that result from that research. 
27. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
28. Policy makers should consider the possibility that Canada should not pursue biobanking.
29. The priority for healthcare should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
30. Aboriginal communities require special consideration concerning healthcare and research.
31. Everyone should donate samples to a biobank for the benefit of everyone. 
32. I trust researchers to control access to my personal samples.
33. I should have property rights to my tissues before or after they leave my body.
34. The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  
35. Scientists should have access to all unidentified, personal samples for research.
36. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government. 
37. Genetic studies of race on enthocultural communities will lead to the discrimination of those same enthocultural communities.

## [Considerations]:
1. I should have property rights to my tissues before or after they leave my body.
2. To me, religious communities need to be consulted about genetic and biobank research. 
3. Researchers should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.  
4. I do not care if my donated sample is connected to my name and medical information.
5. The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  
6. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for bothers me. 
7. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
8. Policy makers should consider the possibility that Canada should not pursue biobanking.
9. I trust researchers to control access to my personal samples.
10. Sampling some people in an ethnocultural community is acceptable only if the whole ethnocultural community has agreed to participate.
11. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.  
12. Participants should be active in the set up and oversight of  biobanks. 
13. Participants should be contacted every time researchers want to use their samples for research.
14. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies.
15. Genetic research will improve our lives.
16. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
17. Participants should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at anytime. 
18. Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.
19. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government. 
20. Genetic information is different from health information. 
21. All participants should be paid for donating their samples to a biobank. 
22. Scientists should have access to all unidentified, personal samples for research.
23. There is no point in consulting the public about ethical issues in science and technology.
24. If someone is a carrier of a genetic disease, they have a responsibility to participate in genetic research.
25. Biobanks will only lead to expensive treatments and high profits. 
26. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health.
27. The priority for healthcare should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
28. There is no risk to the participants who donate to biobanks.
29. Participants who donate their samples for research should be given special access to the treatments and therapies that result from that research. 
30. Genetic studies of disability will lead to the discrimination of people living with the same conditions.
31. Aboriginal communities require special consideration concerning healthcare and research.
32. Everyone should donate samples to a biobank for the benefit of everyone. 
33. My personal sample should never be anonymized since I should be informed of important research results.  
34. It is always permissible to do research on my personally identifiable sample without my prior permission.  
35. Profits from biobanking should be returned to the donating community. 
36. Genetic studies of race on enthocultural communities will lead to the discrimination of those same enthocultural communities. 
37. Educating people about health issues (e.g. diet and lifestyle changes) promises greater health effects than investing in biobanks.
38. Biobanks need independent review boards to determine who should have access to samples. ","1. 8

7. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
8. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
9. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
10. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
11. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
12. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.

14. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
15. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
16. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
17. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
18. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
19. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
20. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
21. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
22. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
23. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
24. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
25. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
26. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.

1. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
2. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
3. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
4. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
5. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
6. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
7. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
8. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
9. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
10. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
11. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
12. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
13. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
14. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
15. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
16. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
17. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
18. Food waste is a major environmental issue
19. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
20. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
21. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
22. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
23. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
24. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
25. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
26. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
27. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
28. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste

## [Considerations]:
1. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
2. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
3. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
4. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
5. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
6. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
7. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
8. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
9. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
10. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
11. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
12. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
13. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
14. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
15. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
16. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
17. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
18. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.

1. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
2. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
3. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
4. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
5. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
6. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
7. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
8. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
9. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
10. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
11. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
12. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
13. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
14. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
15. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
16. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
17. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
18. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
19. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
20. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
21. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
22. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
23. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
24. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
25. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
26. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
27. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
28. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
29. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
30. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
31. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
32. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
33. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
34. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
35. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
36. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
37. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
38. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
39. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
40. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
41. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.

## [Considerations]:
1. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
2. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
3. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
4. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
5. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
6. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
7. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
8. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
9. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
10. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
11. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
12. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
13. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
14. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
15. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
16. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
17. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
18. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
19. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
20. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
21. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
22. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
23. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
24. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
25. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
26. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
27. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
28. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
29. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
30. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
31. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
32.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
33. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
34. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
35. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
36. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
37. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
38. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
39. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
40. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
41. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
42. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
43. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
44. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
45. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
2. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
3. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
4. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities
5. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
6. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
7. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
8. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
9. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
10. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.
11. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
12. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.
13. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
14. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
15. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
16. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
17. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
18. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
19. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
20. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
21. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
22. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
23. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
24. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
25. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
26. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.
27. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
28. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
29. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
30. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
31. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process
32. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
33. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
34. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
35. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
36. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need ","1. 3

24. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
25. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process
26. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
27. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
28. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
29. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.
30. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
31. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
32. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
33. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
34. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
35. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
36. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.","1. 3

2. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
3. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
4. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
5. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
6. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
7. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
8. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
9. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
10. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
11. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
12. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
13. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
14. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
15. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
16. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
17. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
18. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does.

26. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
27. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment.

16. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
17. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
18. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
19. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
20. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
21. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
22. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
23. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
24. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
25. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
26. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
27. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
28. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
29. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
30. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
31. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
32. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
33. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
34. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
35. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
36. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
37. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
38. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
39. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
40. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
41. Genome editing is really cool science.
42. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
43. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
44. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
45. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.","1. 3

26. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
27. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
28. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
29. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
30. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
31. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
32. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
33. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
34. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
35. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
36. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
37. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
38. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
39. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
40. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
41. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
42. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
43. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
44. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
45. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
46. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
47. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
48. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.

## [Considerations]:
1. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
2. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
3. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
4. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
5. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
6. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
7. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
8. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
9. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
10. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
11. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
12. We are a democratic country.
13. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
14. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
15. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
16. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
17. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
18. People get the government they deserve
19. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
20. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
21. I'm always cynical about government processes.
22. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.

## [Considerations]:
1. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
2. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
3. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
4. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
5. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
6. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
7. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
8. I'm always cynical about government processes.
9. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
10. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
11. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
12. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
13. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
14. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
15. We live in a great democracy.
16. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
17. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
18. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
19. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
20. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
21. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
22. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
23. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
24. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
25. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
26. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
27. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
28. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
29. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
30. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
31. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
32. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
33. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
34. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
35. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
36. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
37. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
38. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
39. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
40. We are a democratic country.
41. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
42. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
43. People get the government they deserve
44. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
45. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
46. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
47. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.

## [Considerations]:
1. We live in a great democracy.
2. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
3. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
4. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
5. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
6. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
7. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
8. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
9. People get the government they deserve
10. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
11. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
12. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
13. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
14. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
15. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
16. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
17. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
18. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
19. I'm always cynical about government processes.
20. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
21. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
22. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
23. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
24. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
25. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
26. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
27. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
28. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
29. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
30. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
31. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
32. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
33. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
34. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
35. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
36. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
37. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
38. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
39. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
40. We are a democratic country.
41. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
42. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
43. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
44. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
45. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
46. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
47. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
48. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. ","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
2. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
3. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
4. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
5. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
6. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
7. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
8. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
9. We are a democratic country.
10. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
11. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
12. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
13. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
14. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
15. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
16. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
17. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
18. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
19. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
20. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
21. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
22. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
23. We live in a great democracy.
24. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
25. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
26. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
27. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
28. People get the government they deserve
29. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
30. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
31. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
32. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
33. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
34. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
35. I'm always cynical about government processes.
36. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
37. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
38. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
39. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
40. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
41. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
42. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
43. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
44. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
45. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
46. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
47. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
48. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.","1. 8

1. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
2. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
3. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
4. I'm always cynical about government processes.
5. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
6. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
7. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
8. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
9. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
10. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
11. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
12. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
13. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
14. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
15. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
16. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
17. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
18. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
19. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
20. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
21. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
22. People get the government they deserve
23. We are a democratic country.
24. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
25. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
26. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
27. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
28. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
29. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
30. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
31. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
32. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
33. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
34. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
35. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
36. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
37. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
38. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
39. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
40. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
41. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
42. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
43. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
44. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
45. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
46. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.

## [Considerations]:
1. People get the government they deserve
2. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
3. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
4. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
5. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
6. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
7. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
8. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
9. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
10. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
11. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
12. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
13. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
14. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
15. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
16. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
17. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
18. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
19. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
20. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
21. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
22. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
23. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
24. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
25. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
26. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
27. We live in a great democracy.
28. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
29. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
30. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
31. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
32. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
33. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
34. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
35. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
36. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
37. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
38. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
39. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
40. We are a democratic country.
41. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
42. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
43. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
44. I'm always cynical about government processes.
45. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
46. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
47. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
48. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. ","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
2. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
3. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
4. We are a democratic country.
5. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
6. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
7. I'm always cynical about government processes.
8. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
9. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
10. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
11. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
12. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
13. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
14. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
15. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
16. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
17. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
18. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
19. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
20. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
21. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
22. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
23. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
24. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
25. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
26. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
27. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
28. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
29. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
30. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
31. We live in a great democracy.
32. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
33. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
34. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
35. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
36. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
37. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
38. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
39. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
40. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
41. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
42. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
43. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
44. People get the government they deserve
45. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
46. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
47. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
48. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.","1. 2

7. I care about the planet.
8. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
9. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.

13. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
14. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
15. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
16. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
17. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
18. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
19. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
20. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
21. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
22. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
23. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
24. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
25. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
26. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
27. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
28. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
29. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.

1. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
2. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
3. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
4. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
5. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
6. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
7. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
8. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
9. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
10. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
11. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
12. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
13. We can adapt to the coming changes.
14. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
15. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
16. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
17. I care about the planet.
18. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
19. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
20. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
21. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
22. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
23. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
24. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
25. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
26. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
27. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
28. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
29. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
30. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
31. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.

1. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
2. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
3. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
4. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
5. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
6. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
7. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
8. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
9. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
10. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
11. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
12. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
13. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
14. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
15. We can adapt to the coming changes.
16. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
17. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
18. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
19. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
20. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
21. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
22. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
23. I care about the planet.
24. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
25. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
26. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
27. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
28. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
29. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
30. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
31. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
32. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
33. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.","1. 2

1. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
2. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
3. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
4. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
5. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
6. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
7. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
8. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
9. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
10. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
11. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
12. We can adapt to the coming changes.
13. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
14. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
15. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
16. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
17. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
18. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
19. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
20. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
21. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
22. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
23. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
24. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
25. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
26. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
27. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
28. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.

1. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
2. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
3. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
4. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
5. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
6. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
7. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
8. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
9. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
10. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
11. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
12. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
13. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
14. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
15. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
16. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
17. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
18. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
19. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
20. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
21. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
22. I care about the planet.
23. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
24. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
25. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
26. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
27. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
28. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
29. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
30. We can adapt to the coming changes.
31. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
32. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
33. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
2. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
3. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
4. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
5. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
6. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
7. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
8. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
9. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
10. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
11. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
12. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
13. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
14. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
15. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
16. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
17. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
18. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
19. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
20. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
21. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
22. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
23. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
24. Forest health means jobs.
25. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
26. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
27. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
28. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
29. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
30. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
31. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
32. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
33. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
34. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
35. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
36. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
37. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
38. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
39. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
40. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
41. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
42. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
43. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
44. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
45. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
2. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
3. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
4. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
5. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
6. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
7. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
8. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
9. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
10. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
11. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
12. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
13. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
14. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
15. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
16. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
17. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
18. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
19. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
20. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
21. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
22. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
23. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
24. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
25. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
26. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
27. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
28. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
29. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
30. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
31. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
32. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
33. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
34. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
35. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
36. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
37. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
38. Forest health means jobs.
39. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
40. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
41. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
42. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
43. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
44. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.

## [Considerations]:
1. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
2. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
3. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
4. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
5. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
6. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
7. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
8. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
9. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
10. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
11. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
12. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
13. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
14. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
15. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
16. Forest health means jobs.
17. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
18. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
19. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
20. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
21. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
22. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
23. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
24. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
25. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
26. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
27. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
28. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
29. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
30. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
31. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
32. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
33. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
34. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
35. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
36. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
37. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
38. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
39. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
40. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
41. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
42. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
43. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
44. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
45. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.","1. 8

3. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
4. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
5. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
6. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
7. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.

10. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
11. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
12. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
13. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
14. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
15. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
16. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.

18. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
19. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
20. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
21. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
22. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
23. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
24. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
25. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
26. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
27. Forest health means jobs.
28. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
29. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
30. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
31. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
32. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
33. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
34. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
35. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
36. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
37. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
38. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
39. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
40. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.

## [Considerations]:
1. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
2. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
3. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
4. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
5. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
6. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
7. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
8. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
9. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
10. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
11. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
12. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
13. Forest health means jobs.
14. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
15. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
16. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
17. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
18. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
19. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
20. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
21. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
22. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
23. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
24. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
25. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
26. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
27. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
28. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
29. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
30. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
31. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
32. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
33. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
34. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
35. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
36. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
37. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
38. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
39. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
40. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
41. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
42. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
43. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
44. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
45. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
2. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
3. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
4. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
5. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
6. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
7. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
8. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
9. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
10. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
11. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
12. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
13. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
14. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
15. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
16. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
17. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
18. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
19. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
20. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
21. Forest health means jobs.
22. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
23. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
24. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
25. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
26. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
27. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
28. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
29. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
30. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
31. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
32. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
33. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
34. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
35. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
36. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
37. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
38. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
39. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
40. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
41. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
42. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
43. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
44. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
45. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
2. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
3. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
4. Forest health means jobs.
5. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
6. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
7. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
8. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
9. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
10. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
11. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
12. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
13. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
14. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
15. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
16. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
17. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
18. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
19. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
20. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
21. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
22. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
23. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
24. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
25. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
26. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
27. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
28. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
29. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
30. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
31. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
32. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
33. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
34. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
35. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
36. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
37. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
38. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
39. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
40. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
41. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
42. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
43. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
44. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
45. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
2. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
3. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
4. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
5. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
6. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
7. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
8. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
9. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
10. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
11. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
12. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
13. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
14. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
15. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
16. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
17. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
18. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
19. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
20. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
21. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
22. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
23. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
24. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
25. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
26. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
27. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
28. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
29. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
30. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
31. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
2. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
3. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
4. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
5. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
6. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
7. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
8. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
9. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
10. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
11. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
12. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
13. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
14. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
15. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
16. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
17. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
18. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
19. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
20. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
21. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
22. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
23. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
24. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
25. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
26. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
27. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
28. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
29. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
30. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change.

1. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
2. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
3. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
4. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
5. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
6. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
7. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
8. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
9. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
10. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
11. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
12. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
13. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
14. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
15. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
16. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
17. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
18. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
19. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
20. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
21. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
22. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
23. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
24. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
25. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
26. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
27. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.

## [Considerations]:
1. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
2. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
3. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
4. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
5. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
6. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
7. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
8. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
9. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
10. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
11. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
12. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
13. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
14. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
15. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
16. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
17. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
18. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
19. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
20. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
21. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
22. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
23. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
24. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
25. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
26. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
27. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
28. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
29. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
30. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
31. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
2. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
3. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
4. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
5. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
6. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
7. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
8. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
9. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
10. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
11. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
12. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
13. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
14. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
15. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
16. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
17. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
18. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
19. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
20. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
21. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
22. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
23. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
24. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
25. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
26. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
27. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
28. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
29. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
30. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
31. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
2. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
3. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
4. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
5. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
6. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
7. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
8. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
9. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
10. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
11. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
12. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
13. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
14. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
15. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
16. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
17. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
18. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
19. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
20. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
21. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
22. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
23. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
24. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
25. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
26. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
27. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
28. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
29. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.

4. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
5. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
6. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
7. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
8. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
9. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
10. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
11. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
12. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
13. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
14. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
15. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
16. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
17. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
18. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
19. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
20. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
21. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
22. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
23. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
24. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
25. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
26. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
27. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).

2. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
3. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
4. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
5. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
6. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
7. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
8. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
9. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
10. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
11. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
12. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
13. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
14. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
15. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
16. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
17. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
18. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
19. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
20. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
21. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
22. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
23. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
24. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
25. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
26. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
27. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
28. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
29. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
30. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
31. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
2. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
3. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
4. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
5. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
6. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
7. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
8. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
9. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
10. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
11. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
12. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
13. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
14. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
15. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
16. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
17. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
18. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
19. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
20. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
21. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
22. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
23. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
24. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
25. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
26. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
27. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
28. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
29. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled

1. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
2. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
3. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
4. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
5. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
6. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
7. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
8. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
9. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
10. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
11. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
12. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
13. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
14. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
15. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
16. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
17. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
18. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
19. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
20. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
21. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics

15. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
16. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
17. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)

## [Considerations]:
1. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
2. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
3. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
4. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
5. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
6. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
7. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
8. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
9. Food waste is a major environmental issue
10. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
11. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
12. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
13. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
14. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
15. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
16. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
17. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
18. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
19. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
20. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
21. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
22. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
23. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
24. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
25. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
26. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
27. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
28. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture

3. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
4. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
5. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
6. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
7. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
8. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
9. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
10. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
11. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
12. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
13. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
14. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
15. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
16. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
17. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
18. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
19. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
20. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
21. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
22. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
23. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
24. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
25. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices

## [Considerations]:
1. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
2. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
3. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
4. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
5. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
6. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
7. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
8. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
9. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
10. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
11. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
12. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
13. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
14. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
15. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
16. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
17. Food waste is a major environmental issue
18. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
19. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
20. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
21. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
22. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
23. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
24. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
25. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
26. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
27. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
28. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
29. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)

## [Considerations]:
1. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
2. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
3. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
4. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
5. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
6. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
7. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
8. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
9. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
10. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
11. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
12. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
13. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
14. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
15. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
16. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
17. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
18. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
19. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
20. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
21. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
22. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
23. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
24. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
25. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
26. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
27. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
28. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
29. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.

1. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
2. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
3. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
4. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
5. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
6. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
7. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
8. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
9. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
10. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
11. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
12. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
13. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
14. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
15. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
16. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
17. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
18. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
19. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
20. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
21. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
22. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
23. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
24. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
25. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
26. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
27. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
28. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
29. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.

2. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
3. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
4. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
5. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
6. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
7. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
8. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.

13. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
14. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
15. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
16. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
17. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
18. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
19. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
20. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
21. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.

## [Considerations]:
1. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
2. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
3. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
4. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
5. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
6. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
7. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
8. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
9. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
10. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
11. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
12. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
13. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
14. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
15. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
16. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
17. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
18. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
19. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
20. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
21. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
22. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
23. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
24. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
25. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
26. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
27. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
28. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
29. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
30. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
31. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.

## [Considerations]:
1. It is certain that climate change exists.
2. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
3. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
4. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
5. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
6. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
7. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
8. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
9. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
10. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
11. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
12. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
13. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
14. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
15. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
16. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
17. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
18. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
19. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
20. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
21. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
22. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
23. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
24. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
25. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
26. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
27. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.

## [Considerations]:
1. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
2. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
3. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
4. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
5. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
6. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
7. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
8. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
9. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
10. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
11. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
12. It is certain that climate change exists.
13. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
14. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
15. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
16. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
17. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
18. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
19. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
20. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
21. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
22. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
23. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
24. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
25. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
26. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
27. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
28. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
29. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
30. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
31. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
32. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
33. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.","1. 2

1. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
2. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
3. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
4. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
5. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
6. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
7. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
8. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
9. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
10. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
11. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
12. It is certain that climate change exists.
13. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
14. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
15. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
16. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
17. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
18. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
19. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
20. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
21. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
22. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
23. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
24. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
25. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
26. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
27. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.

1. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
2. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
3. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
4. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
5. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
6. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
7. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
8. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
9. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
10. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
11. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
12. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
13. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
14. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
15. It is certain that climate change exists.
16. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
17. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
18. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
19. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
20. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
21. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
22. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
23. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
24. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
25. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
26. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
27. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
28. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
2. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
3. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
4. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
5. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
6. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
7. It is certain that climate change exists.
8. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
9. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
10. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
11. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
12. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
13. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
14. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
15. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
16. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
17. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
18. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
19. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
20. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
21. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
22. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
23. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
24. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
25. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
26. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
27. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
28. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
29. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
30. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
31. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
32. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
33. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.

3. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
4. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
5. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
6. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
7. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
8. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
9. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
10. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.

12. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
13. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
14. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
15. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
16. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
17. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
18. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.

1. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
2. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
3. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
4. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
5. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
6. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
7. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
8. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
9. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
10. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
11. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
12. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
13. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
14. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
15. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
16. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
17. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
18. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
19. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
20. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
2. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
3. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
4. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
5. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
6. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
7. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
8. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
9. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
10. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
11. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
12. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
13. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
14. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
15. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
16. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
17. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
18. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
19. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
20. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
21. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
22. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
23. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
24. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
25. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
26. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
27. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
28. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
29. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
30. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
31. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
32. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
33. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
34. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
35. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
36. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
37. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
38. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
39. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
40. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
41. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
42. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
43. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
2. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
3. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
4. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
5. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
6. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
7. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
8. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
9. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
10. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
11. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
12. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
13. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
14. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
15. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
16. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
17. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
18. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
19. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
20. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
21. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
22. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
23. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
24. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
25. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
26. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
27. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
28. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
29. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
30. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
31. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
32. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
33. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
34. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
35. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
36. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
37. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
38. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
39. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
40. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
41. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
42. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
43. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
2. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
3. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
4. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
5. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
6. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
7. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
8. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
9. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
10. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
11. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
12. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
13. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
14. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
15. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
16. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
17. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
18. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
19. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
20. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
21. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
22. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
23. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
24. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
25. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
26. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
27. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
28. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
29. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
30. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
31. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
32. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
33. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
34. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
35. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
36. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
37. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
38. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
39. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
40. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
41. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
42. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.

## [Considerations]:
1. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
2. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
3. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
4. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
5. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
6. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
7. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
8. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
9. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
10. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
11. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
12. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
13. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
14. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
15. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
16. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
17. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
18. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
19. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
20. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
21. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
22. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
23. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
24. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
25. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
26. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
27. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
28. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
29. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
30. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
31. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
32. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
33. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
34. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
35. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
36. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
37. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
38. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
39. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
40. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
41. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries

## [Considerations]:
1. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
2. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
3. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
4. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
5. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
6. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
7. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
8. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
9. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
10. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
11. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
12. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
13. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
14. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
15. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
16. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
17. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
18. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
19. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
20. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
21. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
22. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
23. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
24. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
25. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
26. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
27. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
28. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
29. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
30. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
31. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
32. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
33. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
34. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
35. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
36. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
37. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
38. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
39. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
40. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
41. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
42. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
43. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.","1. 2

2. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
3. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
4. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
5. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
6. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
7. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
8. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
9. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
10. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
11. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
12. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
13. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
14. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
15. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
16. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
17. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
18. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
19. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
20. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
21. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
22. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
23. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
24. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
25. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
26. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
27. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
28. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
29. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
30. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
31. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
32. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
33. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
34. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
35. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
36. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
37. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
38. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
39. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
40. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
41. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
42. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.

## [Considerations]:
1. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
2. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
3. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
4. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
5.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
6. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
7. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
8. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
9. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
10. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
11. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
12. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
13. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
14. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
15. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
16. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
17. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
18. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
19. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
20. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
21. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
22. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
23. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
24. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
25. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
26. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
27. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
28. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
29. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
30. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
31. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
32. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
33. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
34. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
35. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
36. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
37. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
38. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
39. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
40. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
41. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
42. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
43. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
44. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
45. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.","1. 2

29. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
30. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
31. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
32. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
33. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
34. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
35. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
36. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
37. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
38. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
39. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
40. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
41. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
42. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
43. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
44. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.

## [Considerations]:
1. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
2. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
3. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
4. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
5. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
6. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
7. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
8. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
9. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
10. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
11. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
12. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
13. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
14. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
15. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
16. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
17. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
18. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
19. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
20. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
21. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
22. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
23. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
24. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
25. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
26. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
27. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
28. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
29. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
30. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
31. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
32. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
33. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
34. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
35. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
36.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
37. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
38. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
39. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
40. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
41. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
42. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
43. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
44. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.

## [Considerations]:
1. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
2. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
3. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
4. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
5. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
6. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
7. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
8. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
9. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
10. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
11. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
12. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
13. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
14. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
15. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
16. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
17. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
18. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
19. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
20. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
21. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
22. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
23. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
24. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
25. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
26. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
27. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
28. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
29. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
30. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
31. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
32. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
33. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
34. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
35. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
36. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
37. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
38.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
39. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
40. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
41. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
42. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
43. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
44. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
45. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.","1. 3

3. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
4. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
5. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
6. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
7. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
8. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
9. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
10. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
11. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
12. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
13. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
14. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
15. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
16.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
17. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
18. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
19. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
20. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
21. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
22. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
23. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
24. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
25. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
26. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
27. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
28. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
29. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
30. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
31. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
32. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
33. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
34. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
35. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
36. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
37. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
38. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
39. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
40. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
41. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
42. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
43. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
44. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
45. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
2. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
3. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
4. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
5. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
6. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
7. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
8. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
9. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
10. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
11. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
12. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
13. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
14. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
15. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
16. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
17. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
18. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
19. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
20. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
21. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
22. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
23. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
24. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
25. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
26. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
27. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
28. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
29. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
30. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
31. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
32. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
33. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
34. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
35. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
36. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
37. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
38. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
39. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
40. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
41. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
42.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
43. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
44. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.

## [Considerations]:
1. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
2. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
3. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
4. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
5. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
6. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
7. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
8. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
9. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
10. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
11. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
12. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
13. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
14. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
15. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
16. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
17. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
18. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
19. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
20. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
21.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
22. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
23. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
24. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
25. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
26. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
27. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
28. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
29. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
30. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
31. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
32. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
33. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
34. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
35. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
36. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
37. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
38. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
39. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
40. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
41. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
42. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
43. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
44. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
45. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. ","1. 9

5. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
6. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
7. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
8. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
9. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
10. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
11. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
12. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
13.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
14. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
15. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
16. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
17. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
18. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
19. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
20. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
21. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
22. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
23. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
24. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
25. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
26. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
27. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
28. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
29. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
30. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
31. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
32. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
33. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
34. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
35. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
36. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
37. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
38. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
39. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
40. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
41. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
42. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
43. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
44. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
45. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
2. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
3. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
4. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
5. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
6. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
7. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
8. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
9. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
10. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
11. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
12. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
13. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
14. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
15. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
16. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
17.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
18. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
19. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
20. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
21. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
22. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
23. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
24. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
25. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
26. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
27. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
28. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
29. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
30. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
31. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
32. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
33. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
34. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
35. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
36. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
37. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
38. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
39. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
40. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
41. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
42. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
43. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
44. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
45. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
2. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
3. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
4. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
5. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
6. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
7. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
8. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
9. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
10. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
11. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
12. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
13. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
14. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
15. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
16. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
17. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
18. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
19. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
20. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
21. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
22. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
23. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
24. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
25. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
26. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
27. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
28. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
29. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
30. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
31. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
32. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
33. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
34. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
35. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
36. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
37. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
38. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
39. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
40. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
41.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
42. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
43. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
44. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
45. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
2. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
3. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
4. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
5. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
6. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
7. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.
8. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
9. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.
10. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
11. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
12. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
13. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
14. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
15. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
16. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
17. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
18. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
19. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
20. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
21. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process
22. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
23. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
24. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
25. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
26. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
27. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities
28. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
29. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
30. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
31. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
32. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.
33. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
34. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
35. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
36. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance","1. 3

2. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
3. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
4. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
5. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
6. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
7. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
8. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
9. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
10. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
11. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
12. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
13. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
14. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
15. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
16. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
17. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
18. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
19. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
20. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
21. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
22. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
23. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
24. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
25. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
26. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
27. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
28. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
29. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
30. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
31. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
32. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
33. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.

1. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
2. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
3. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
4. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
5. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
6. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
7. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
8. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
9. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
10. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
11. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
12. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
13. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
14. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
15. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
16. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
17. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
18. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
19. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
20. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
21. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
22. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
23. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
24. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
25. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
26. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
27. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
28. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
29. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
30. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
31. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
32. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
33. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
34. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
35. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
2. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
3. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
4. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
5. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
6. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
7. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
8. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
9. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
10. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
11. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
12. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
13. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
14. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
15. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
16. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
17. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
18. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
19. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
20. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
21. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
22. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
23. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
24. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
25. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
26. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
27. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
28. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
29. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
30. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
31. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
32. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.

## [Considerations]:
1. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
2. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
3. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
4. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
5. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
6. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
7. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
8. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
9. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
10. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
11. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
12. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
13. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
14. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
15. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
16. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
17. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
18. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
19. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
20. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
21. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
22. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
23. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
24. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
25. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
26. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
27. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
28. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
29. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
30. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
31. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
32. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
33. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
34. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
2. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
3. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
4. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
5. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
6. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
7. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
8. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
9. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
10. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
11. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
12. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
13. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
14. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
15. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
16. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
17. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
18. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
19. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
20. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
21. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
22. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
23. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
24. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
25. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
26. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
27. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
28. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
29. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
30. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.

## [Considerations]:
1. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
2. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
3. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
4. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
5. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
6. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
7. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
8. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
9. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
10. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
11. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
12. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
13. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
14. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
15. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
16. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
17. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
18. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
19. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
20. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
21. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
22. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
23. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
24. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
25. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
26. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
27. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
28. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
29. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
30. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
31. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
32. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
33. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
34. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does.

## [Considerations]:
1. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
2. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
3. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
4. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
5. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
6. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
7. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
8. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
9. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
10. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
11. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
12. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
13. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
14. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
15. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
16. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
17. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
18. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
19. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
20. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
21. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
22. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
23. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
24. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
25. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
26. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
27. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
28. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
29. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
30. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
31. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
32. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
33. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
34. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
35. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. ","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
2. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
3. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
4. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
5. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
6. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
7. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
8. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
9. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
10. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
11. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
12. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
13. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
14. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
15. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
16. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
17. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
18. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
19. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
20. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
21. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
22. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
23. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
24. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
25. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
26. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
27. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
28. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
29. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
30. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
31. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
32. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
33. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
34. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
35. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
2. Genome editing is really cool science.
3. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
4. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
5. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
6. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
7. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
8. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
9. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
10. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
11. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
12. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
13. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
14. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
15. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
16. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
17. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
18. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
19. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
20. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
21. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
22. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
23. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
24. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
25. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
26. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
27. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
28. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
29. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
30. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
31. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
32. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
33. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
34. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
35. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
36. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
37. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
38. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
39. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
40. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
41. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
42. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
43. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
44. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
45. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. ","1. 2

1. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
2. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
3. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
4. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
5. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
6. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
7. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
8. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
9. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
10. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
11. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
12. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
13. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
14. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
15. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
16. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
17. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
18. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
19. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
20. Genome editing is really cool science.
21. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
22. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
23. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
24. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
25. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
26. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
27. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
28. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
29. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
30. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
31. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
32. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
33. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.

36. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
37. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
38. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
39. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
40. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.

4. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
5. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
6. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
7. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
8. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
9. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
10. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
11. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
12. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
13. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
14. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
15. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
16. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
17. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
18. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
19. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
20. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
21. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
22. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
23. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
24. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
25. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
26. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
27. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
28. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
29. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
30. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
31. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
32. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
33. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
34. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
35. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
36. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
37. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
38. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
39. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.

41. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
42. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
43. Genome editing is really cool science.
44. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.

## [Considerations]:
1. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
2. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
3. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
4. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
5. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
6. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
7. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
8. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
9. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
10. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
11. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
12. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
13. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
14. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
15. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
16. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
17. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
18. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
19. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
20. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
21. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
22. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
23. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
24. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
25. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
26. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
27. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
28. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
29. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
30. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
31. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
32. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.

1. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
2. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
3. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
4. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
5. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
6. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
7. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
8. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
9. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
10. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
11. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
12. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
13. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
14. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
15. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
16. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
17. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
18. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
19. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
20. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
21. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
22. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.

3. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
4. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
5. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
6. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
7. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
8. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
9. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
10. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
11. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.

18. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
19. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
20. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.

## [Considerations]:
1. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
2. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
3. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
4. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
5. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
6. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
7. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
8. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
9. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
10. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
11. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
12. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
13. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
14. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
15. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
16. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
17. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
18. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
19. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
20. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
21. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
22. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
23. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.

1. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
2. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
3. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
4. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
5. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
6. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
7. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
8. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
9. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
10. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
11. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
12. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
13. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
14. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
15. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
16. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
17. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
18. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
19. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
20. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.

## [Considerations]:
1. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
2. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
3. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
4. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
5. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
6. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
7. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
8. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
9. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
10. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
11. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.

18. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
19. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
20. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
21. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
22. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.

## [Considerations]:
1. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
2. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
3. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
4. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
5. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
6. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
7. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
8. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
9. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
10. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
11. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
12. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
13. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
14. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
15. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
16. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
17. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
18. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
19. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
20. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
21. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
22. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
23. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.

3. Genetic research will improve our lives.
4. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
5. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
6. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
7. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
8. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
9. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
10. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
11. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
12. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
13. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
14. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
15. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
16. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
17. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
18. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
19. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
20. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
21. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
22. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
23. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
24. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
25. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.

27. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
28. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
29. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
30. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
31. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
32. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
33. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
34. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
35. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
36. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
37. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
38. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
39. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
40. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.

## [Considerations]:
1. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
2. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
3. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
4. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
5. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
6. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
7. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
8. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
9. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
10. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
11. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
12. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
13. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
14. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
15. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
16. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
17. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
18. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
19. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
20. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
21. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
22. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
23. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
24. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
25. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
26. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
27. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
28. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
29. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
30. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
31. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
32. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
33. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
34. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
35. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
36. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
37. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
38. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
39. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
40. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
41. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
42. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
43. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
44. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
45. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
46. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
47. Genetic research will improve our lives.
48. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
49. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.","1. 3

40. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
41. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
42. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
43. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
44. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
45. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
46. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
47. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
48. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
49. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
2. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
3. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
4. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
5. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
6. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
7. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
8. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
9. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
10. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
11. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
12. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
13. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
14. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.

## [Considerations]:
1. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
2. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
3. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
4. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
5. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
6. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
7. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
8. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
9. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
10. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
11. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
12. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
13. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
14. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
15. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
16. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
17. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
18. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
19. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
20. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.","1. 6
