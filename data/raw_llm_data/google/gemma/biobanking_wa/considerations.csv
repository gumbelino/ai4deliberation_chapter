The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.,C3. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.,C4. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.,C5. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.,C6. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.,C7. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies,C8. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.,C9. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.,C10. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.,C11. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.,C12. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.,C13. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.,"C14. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.",C15. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.,C16. Genetic research will improve our lives.,C17. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.,C18. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.,C19. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.,C20. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results,C21. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.,C22. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research,C23. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.,C24. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.,C25.

People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.,C27. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body,C28. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.,C29. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.,C30.

I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.",C34. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples,C35. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.,C36. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.,C37. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.,C38. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.,"C39. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.","C40.

I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.",C42. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples,C43. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.,C44. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.,"C45. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.",C46. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.,C47. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.,C48. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.,C49. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
