32. The future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by everyone and not just by those who live in the Bloomfield area.
33. I don't know how, but I think that there must be some way in which everybody benefits from protecting the rainforest near the Bloomfield Track.
34. I don't really know who benefits most from the protection of Rainforest in the Daintree.
35. I have no idea what the people in the Bloomfield area think about the Bloomfield Track.
36. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Daintree region because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
37. Let's fix the problems in the Daintree just for now. The future will take care of itself.
38. I'm not sure if the future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by locals, outsiders or both.
39. The Bloomfield Track is important because it allows quick access to remote areas of the North.
40. If the Bloomfield Track is sealed (bitumenized) there will not be a rapid increase in environmentally damaging development in the Daintree area in the future It may even benefit the environment there.
41. The coral reefs along the foreshore below the Bloomfield Track are not badly affected by the road.
42. I don't know if improving the Bloomfield Track would lead to a rapid acceleration of development in the area to the detriment of the environment.","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
2. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
3. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
4. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
5. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
6. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
7. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
8. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
9. People get the government they deserve
10. I'm always cynical about government processes.
11. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
12. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
13. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
14. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
15. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
16. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
17. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
18. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
19. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
20. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
21. We live in a great democracy.
22. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
23. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
24. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
25. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
26. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
27. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
28. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
29. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
30. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
31. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
32. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
33. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
34. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
35. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
36. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
37. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
38. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
39. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
40. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
41. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
42. We are a democratic country.
43. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
44. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
45. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
46. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
47. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
48. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
2. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
3. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
4. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
5. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
6. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
7. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
8. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
9. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
10. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
11. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
12. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
13. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
14. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
15. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
16. I'm always cynical about government processes.
17. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
18. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
19. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
20. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
21. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
22. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
23. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
24. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
25. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
26. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
27. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
28. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
29. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
30. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
31. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
32. We are a democratic country.
33. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
34. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
35. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
36. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
37. People get the government they deserve
38. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
39. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
40. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
41. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
42. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
43. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
44. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
45. We live in a great democracy.
46. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
47. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
48. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
2. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
3. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
4. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
5. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
6. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
7. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
8. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
9. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
10. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
11. We are a democratic country.
12. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
13. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
14. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
15. We live in a great democracy.
16. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
17. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
18. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
19. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
20. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
21. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
22. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
23. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
24. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
25. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
26. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
27. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
28. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
29. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
30. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
31. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
32. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
33. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
34. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
35. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
36. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
37. People get the government they deserve
38. I'm always cynical about government processes.
39. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
40. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
41. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
42. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
43. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
44. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
45. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
46. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
47. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.

18. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
19. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
20. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
21. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
22. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
23. People get the government they deserve
24. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
25. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
26. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
27. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
28. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
29. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
30. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
31. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
32. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
33. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
34. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
35. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
36. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
37. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
38. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
39. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
40. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
41. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
42. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
43. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
44. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
45. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
46. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
47. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
48. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.","1. 3

6. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
7. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.

9. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
10. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
11. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.

13. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
14. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.

17. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
18. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
2. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
3. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
4. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
5. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
6. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
7. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
8. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
9. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
10. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
11. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
12. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
13. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
14. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
15. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
16. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
17. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
18. Forest health means jobs.
19. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
20. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
21. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
22. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
23. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
24. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
25. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
26. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
27. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
28. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
29. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
30. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
31. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
32. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
33. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
34. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
35. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
36. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
37. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
38. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
39. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
40. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
41. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
42. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
43. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
44. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
45. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. ","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
2. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
3. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
4. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
5. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
6. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
7. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
8. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
9. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
10. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
11. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
12. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
13. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
14. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
15. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
16. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
17. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
18. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
19. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
20. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
21. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
22. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
23. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
24. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
25. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
26. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
27. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
28. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
29. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
30. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
31. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
32. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
33. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
34. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
35. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
36. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
37. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
38. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
39. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
40. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
41. Forest health means jobs.
42. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
43. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
44. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
45. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. ","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
2. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
3. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
4. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
5. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
6. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
7. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
8. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
9. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
10. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
11. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
12. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
13. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
14. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
15. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
16. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
17. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
18. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
19. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
20. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
21. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
22. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
23. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
24. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
25. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
26. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
27. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
28. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
29. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
30. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
31. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
32. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
33. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
34. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
35. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
36. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
37. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
38. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
39. Forest health means jobs.
40. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
41. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
42. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
43. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
44. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
45. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.","1. 3

11. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
12. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
13. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
14. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
15. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
16. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
17. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
18. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
19. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
20. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
21. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
22. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
23. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
24. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
25. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
26. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
27. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
28. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
29. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
30. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
31. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.

## [Considerations]:
1. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
2. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
3. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
4. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
5. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
6. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
7. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
8. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
9. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
10. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
11. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
12. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
13. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
14. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
15. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
16. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
17. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
18. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
19. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
20. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
21. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
22. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.

## [Considerations]:
1. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
2. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
3. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
4. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
5. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
6. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
7. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
8. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
9. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
10. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
11. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
12. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
13. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
14. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
15. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
16. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
17. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
18. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
19. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
20. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
21. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
22. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
23. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
24. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
25. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
26. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
27. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
28. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
29. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
30. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.

1. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
2. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
3. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
4. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
5. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
6. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
7. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
8. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
9. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
10. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
11. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
12. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
13. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
14. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
15. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
16. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
17. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
18. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
19. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
20. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
21. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
22. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
23. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
24. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
25. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
26. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
27. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
28. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
29. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.

## [Considerations]:
1. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
2. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
3. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
4. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
5. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
6. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
7. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
8. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
9. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
10. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
11. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
12. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
13. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
14. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
15. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
16. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
17. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
18. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
19. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
20. Food waste is a major environmental issue
21. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
22. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
23. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
24. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
25. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
26. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
27. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.

2. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
3. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
4. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
5. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
6. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
7. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
8. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
9. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
10. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
11. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
12. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
13. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
14. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
15. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
16. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
17. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
18. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
19. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
20. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
21. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
22. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
23. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
24. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
25. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
26. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
27. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
28. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.

## [Considerations]:
1. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
2. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
3. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
4. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
5. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
6. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
7. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
8. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
9. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
10. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
11. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
12. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
13. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
14. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
15. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
16. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
17. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
18. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
19. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
20. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
21. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
22. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
23. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
24. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
25. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
26. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
27. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
28. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
29. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
30. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
31. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
32. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).","1. 4

## [Considerations]:
1. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
2. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
3. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
4. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
5. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
6. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
7. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
8. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
9. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
10. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
11. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
12. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
13. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
14. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
15. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
16. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
17. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
18. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
19. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
20. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
21. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
22. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
23. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
24. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
25. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
26. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
27. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
28. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
29. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
30. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
31. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
32. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.","1. 1

## [Considerations]:
1. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
2. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
3. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
4. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
5. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
6. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
7. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
8. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
9. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
10. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
11. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
12. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
13. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
14. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
15. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
16. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
17. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
18. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
19. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
20. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
21. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
22. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
23. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
24. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
25. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
26. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
27. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
28. It is certain that climate change exists.
29. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
30. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
31. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
32. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
33. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
2. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
3. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
4. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
5. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
6. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
7. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
8. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
9. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
10. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
11. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
12. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
13. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
14. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
15. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
16. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
17. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
18. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
19. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
20. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
2. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
3. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
4. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
5. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
6. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
7. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
8. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
9. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
10. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
11. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
12. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
13. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
14. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
15. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
16. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
17. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
18. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
19. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
20. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
21. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
22. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
23. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
24. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
25. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
26. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
27. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
28. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
29. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
30. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
31. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
32. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
33. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
34. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
35. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
36. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
37. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
38. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
39. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
40. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
41. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
42. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
43. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
2. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
3. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
4. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
5. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
6. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
7. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
8. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
9. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
10. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
11. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
12. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
13. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
14. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
15. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
16. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
17. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
18. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
19. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
20. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
21. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
22. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
23. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
24. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
25. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
26. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
27. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
28. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
29. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
30. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
31. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
32. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
33. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
34. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
35. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
36. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
37. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
38. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
39. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
40. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
41. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.

## [Considerations]:
1. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
2. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
3. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
4. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
5. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
6. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
7. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
8. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
9. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
10. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
11. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
12. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.

18. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
19. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
20. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
21. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
22. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
23. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.

28. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
29. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
30. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
31. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
32. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
33. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
34. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
35. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
36. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
37. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
38. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
39. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.

## [Considerations]:
1. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
2. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
3. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
4. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
5. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
6. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
7. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
8. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
9. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
10. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
11. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
12. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
13. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
14. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
15. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
16. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
17. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
18. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
19. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
20. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
21. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
22. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
23. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
24. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
25. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
26. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
27. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
28. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
29. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
30. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
31. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
32.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
33. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
34. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
35. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
36. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
37. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
38. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
39. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
40. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
41. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
42. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
43. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
44. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
45. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. ","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
2. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
3. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
4. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
5. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
6. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
7. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
8. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
9. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
10. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
11. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
12. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
13. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
14. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
15. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
16. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
17. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
18. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
19. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
20. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
21. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
22. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
23. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
24. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
25.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
26. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
27. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
28. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
29. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
30. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
31. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
32. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
33. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
34. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
35. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
36. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
37. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
38. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
39. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
40. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
41. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
42. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
43. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
44. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
45. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
2. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
3. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
4. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
5. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
6. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
7. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
8. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
9. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
10. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
11. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
12. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
13. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
14. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
15. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
16. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
17. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
18. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
19. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
20. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
21. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
22. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
23. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
24. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
25. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
26. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
27. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
28. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
29. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
30. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
31. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
32. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
33. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
34. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
35. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
36. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
37.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
38. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
39. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
40. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
41. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
42. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
43. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
44. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
45. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.","1. 7

19. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
20. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
21. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
22. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
23. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
24. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
25. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
26. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
27. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
28. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
29. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
30. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
31. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
32. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
33. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
34. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
35. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
36. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
37. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
38. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
39. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
40. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
41.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
42. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
43. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
44. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
45. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
2. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
3. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
4. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
5. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
6. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
7. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
8. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
9. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
10. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
11. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
12. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
13. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
14. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
15. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
16. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
17. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
18. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
19. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
20. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
21. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
22. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
23. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
24. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
25. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
26. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
27. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
28. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
29. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
30. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
31. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
32. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
33.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
34. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
35. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
36. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
37. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
38. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
39. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
40. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
41. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
42. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
43. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
44. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
45. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. ","1. 3

1. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
2. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
3. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.
4. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
5. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
6. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
7. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
8. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
9. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
10. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
11. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
12. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.
13. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
14. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
15. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
16. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
17. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
18. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
19. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
20. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
21. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
22. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
23. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna

## [Considerations]:
1. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
2. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
3. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
4. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
5. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
6. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
7. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
8. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
9. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
10. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
11. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
12. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
13. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
14. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
15. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
16. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
17. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
18. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
19. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
20. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
21. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
22. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
23. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
24. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
25. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
26. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
27. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
28. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
29. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
30. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
31. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
32. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
33. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
34. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.

## [Considerations]:
1. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
2. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
3. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
4. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
5. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
6. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
7. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
8. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
9. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
10. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
11. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
12. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
13. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
14. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
15. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
16. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
17. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
18. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
19. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
20. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
21. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
22. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
23. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
24. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
25. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
26. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
27. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
28. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
29. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
30. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
31. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
32. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.

## [Considerations]:
1. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
2. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
3. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
4. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
5. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
6. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
7. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
8. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
9. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
10. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
11. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
12. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
13. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
14. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
15. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
16. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
17. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
18. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
19. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
20. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
21. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
22. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
23. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
24. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
25. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
26. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
27. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
28. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
29. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
30. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
31. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
32. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
33. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
34. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.

21. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
22. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
23. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
24. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.

## [Considerations]:
1. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
2. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
3. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
4. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
5. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
6. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
7. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
8. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
9. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
10. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
11. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
12. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
13. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
14. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
15. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
16. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
17. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
18. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
19. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
20. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
21. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
22. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
23. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
24. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
25. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
26. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
27. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
28. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
29. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
30. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
31. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
32. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
33. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
34. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
35. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
36. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
37. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
38. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
39. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
40. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
41. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
42. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
43. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.

16. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
17. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
18. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
19. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
20. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
21. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
22. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
23. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.

## [Considerations]:
1. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
2. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
3. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
4. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
5. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
6. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
7. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
8. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
9. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
10. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
11. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
12. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
13. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
14. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
15. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
16. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
17. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
18. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
19. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
20. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
21. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
22. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
23. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
24. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.","1. 5

1. Cautious Implementation: Minimal input of public resources to development biobanking Use resources  — use instead for other approaches to improving health. Very strict oversight of use of biobanks and strong privacy provisions.
2. Publicly Funded with strong regulation: A biobanking system owned and run by the government, who is also responsible for oversight and privacy provisions, as well as controlling access.
3. Publicly Funded with minimal regulation: A biobanking system owned and run by the government, who is also responsible for oversight and privacy provisions, as well as controlling access.
4. Privately Funded with minimal regulation: Minimal regulation of privately run biobanking system with maximum participation of the public. Low privacy provisions.
5. Privately Funded with strong regulation: A BB system where funding is provided mostly by private companies, withstrong government oversight and privacy provisions.
6. High Privacy: Implementation of a (publicy or privately owned) biobanking system where privacy of individuals is paramount. Stored data and biological samples for research requires the authorization of individual donors.

## [Considerations]:
1. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
2. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
3. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
4. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
5. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
6. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
7. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
8. Genetic research will improve our lives.
9. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
10. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
11. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
12. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
13. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
14. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
15. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
16. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
17. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
18. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
19. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
20. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
21. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
22. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
23. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
24. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
25. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
26. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
27. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
28. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
29. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
30. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
31. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
32. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
33. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
34. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
35. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
36. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
37. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
38. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
39. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
40. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
41. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
42. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
43. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
44. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
45. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
46. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
47. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
48. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
49. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.","1. 2
