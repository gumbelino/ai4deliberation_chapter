## [Considerations]:
1. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
2. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
3. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
4. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
5. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
6. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
7. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
8. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
9. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
10. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
11. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
12. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
13. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
14. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
15. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
16. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
17. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
18. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
19. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
20. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
21. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
22. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
23. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
24. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
25. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
26. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
27. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
28. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
29. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
30. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
31. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
32. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
33. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
34. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
35. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
36. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
37. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
38. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
39. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
40. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
41. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
42. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
43. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”","7

6. If we don't take steps to protect the Daintree Rainforest future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the area as we do now.
7. When it comes to the Bloomfield track, people living in Cairns are in no position to judge what the interests of the local residents of Bloomfield are.

23. I don't know if improving the Bloomfield Track would lead to a rapid acceleration of development in the area to the detriment of the environment.

25. Conservation in the Daintree area is worthwhile at whatever cost.
26. The fate of the Bloomfield Track is of no concern to me.
27. Any decision about the Bloomfield Track will greatly affect people like me.
28. The Wujal Wujal Community is better off now that the Bloomfield Track has been built.

30. The future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by everyone and not just by those who live in the Bloomfield area.
31. If the Bloomfield Track is sealed (bitumenized) there will not be a rapid increase in environmentally damaging development in the Daintree area in the future It may even benefit the environment there.
32. I would be worse off if more of the Daintree rainforest is protected.
33. I have no idea what the people in the Bloomfield area think about the Bloomfield Track.
34. There is no reason to believe that the Daintree Rainforest is under threat.

3. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
4. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
5. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
6. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
7. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
8. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
9. People get the government they deserve
10. I'm always cynical about government processes.
11. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
12. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
13. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
14. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
15. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
16. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
17. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
18. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
19. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
20. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
21. We live in a great democracy.
22. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
23. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
24. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
25. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
26. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
27. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
28. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
29. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
30. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
31. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
32. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
33. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
34. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
35. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
36. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
37. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
38. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
39. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
40. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
41. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
42. We are a democratic country.
43. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
44. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
45. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
46. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.

## [Considerations]:
1. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
2. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
3. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
4. We live in a great democracy.
5. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
6. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
7. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
8. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
9. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
10. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
11. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
12. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
13. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
14. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
15. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
16. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
17. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
18. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
19. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
20. I'm always cynical about government processes.
21. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
22. We are a democratic country.
23. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
24. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
25. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
26. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
27. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
28. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
29. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
30. People get the government they deserve
31. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
32. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
33. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
34. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
35. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
36. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
37. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
38. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
39. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
40. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
41. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
42. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
43. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
44. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
45. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
46. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
47. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.

3. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
4. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
5. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
6. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
7. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
8. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
9. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
10. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
11. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
12. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
13. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
14. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
15. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
16. I'm always cynical about government processes.
17. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
18. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
19. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
20. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
21. People get the government they deserve
22. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
23. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
24. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
25. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
26. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
27. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
28. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
29. We are a democratic country.
30. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
31. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
32. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
33. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
34. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
35. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
36. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
37. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
38. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
39. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
40. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
41. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
42. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
43. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
44. We live in a great democracy.
45. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
46. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
47. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.

21. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
22. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
23. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
24. We are a democratic country.
25. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
26. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
27. I'm always cynical about government processes.
28. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
29. We live in a great democracy.
30. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
31. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
32. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
33. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
34. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
35. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
36. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
37. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
38. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
39. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
40. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
41. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
42. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
43. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
44. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
45. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
46. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market

1. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
2. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
3. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
4. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
5. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
6. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
7. We live in a great democracy.
8. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
9. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
10. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
11. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
12. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
13. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
14. We are a democratic country.
15. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
16. I'm always cynical about government processes.
17. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
18. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
19. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
20. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
21. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
22. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
23. People get the government they deserve
24. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
25. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
26. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
27. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?

29. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.

31. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
32. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
33. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
34. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
35. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
36. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
37. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
38. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
39. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
40. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
41. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
42. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
43. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
44. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.

46. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.

8. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
9. We can adapt to the coming changes.

14. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
15. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
16. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
17. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
18. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
19. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
20. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
21. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.

2. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
3. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
4. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
5. I care about the planet.
6. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
7. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
8. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
9. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
10. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
11. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
12. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
13. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
14. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
15. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
16. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
17. We can adapt to the coming changes.
18. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
19. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
20. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
21. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
22. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
23. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
24. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
25. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
26. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
27. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
28. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
29. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
30. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
31. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
32. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
33. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
2. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
3. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
4. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
5. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
6. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
7. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
8. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
9. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
10. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
11. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
12. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
13. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
14. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
15. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
16. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
17. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
18. Forest health means jobs.
19. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
20. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
21. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
22. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
23. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
24. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
25. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
26. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
27. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
28. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
29. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
30. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
31. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
32. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
33. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
34. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
35. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.

## [Considerations]:
1. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
2. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
3. Forest health means jobs.
4. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
5. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
6. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
7. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
8. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
9. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
10. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
11. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
12. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
13. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
14. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
15. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
16. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
17. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
18. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
19. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
20. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
21. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
22. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
23. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
24. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
25. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
26. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
27. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
28. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
29. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
30. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
31. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
32. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
33. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
34. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
35. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
36. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
37. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
38. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
39. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
40. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
41. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
42. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
43. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
44. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run.

## [Considerations]:
1. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
2. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
3. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
4. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
5. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
6. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
7. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
8. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
9. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
10. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
11. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
12. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
13. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
14. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
15. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
16. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
17. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
18. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
19. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
20. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
21. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
22. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
23. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
24. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
25. Forest health means jobs.
26. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
27. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
28. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
29. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
30. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
31. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
32. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
33. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
34. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
35. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
36. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
37. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
38. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
39. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
40. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
41. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
42. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
43. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
44. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
45. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.","3

1. It is always permissible to do research on my personally identifiable sample without my prior permission.  
2. Participants who donate their samples for research should be given special access to the treatments and therapies that result from that research. 
3. Genetic information is different from health information. 
4. Participants should be contacted every time researchers want to use their samples for research.
5. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.  
6. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government. 
7. If someone is a carrier of a genetic disease, they have a responsibility to participate in genetic research.
8. Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.
9. There is no point in consulting the public about ethical issues in science and technology.
10. Aboriginal communities require special consideration concerning healthcare and research.
11. Policy makers should consider the possibility that Canada should not pursue biobanking.
12. There is no risk to the participants who donate to biobanks.
13. Participants should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at anytime. 
14. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies.
15. The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  
16. I trust researchers to control access to my personal samples.
17. Genetic research will improve our lives.
18. Educating people about health issues (e.g. diet and lifestyle changes) promises greater health effects than investing in biobanks.
19. I should have property rights to my tissues before or after they leave my body.
20. Biobanks need independent review boards to determine who should have access to samples. 
21. Scientists should have access to all unidentified, personal samples for research.
22. The priority for healthcare should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
23. Sampling some people in an ethnocultural community is acceptable only if the whole ethnocultural community has agreed to participate.
24. Everyone should donate samples to a biobank for the benefit of everyone. 
25. I do not care if my donated sample is connected to my name and medical information.
26. All participants should be paid for donating their samples to a biobank. 
27. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health.
28. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
29. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
30. Biobanks will only lead to expensive treatments and high profits. 
31. Researchers should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.  
32. Participants should be active in the set up and oversight of  biobanks. 
33. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for bothers me. 
34. Genetic studies of disability will lead to the discrimination of people living with the same conditions.
35. To me, religious communities need to be consulted about genetic and biobank research. 
36. Profits from biobanking should be returned to the donating community. 
37. Genetic studies of race on enthocultural communities will lead to the discrimination of those same enthocultural communities. 
38. My personal sample should never be anonymized since I should be informed of important research results.  ","1. 1

## [Considerations]:
1. Participants who donate their samples for research should be given special access to the treatments and therapies that result from that research. 
2. Policy makers should consider the possibility that Canada should not pursue biobanking.
3. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
4. Genetic studies of disability will lead to the discrimination of people living with the same conditions.
5. Profits from biobanking should be returned to the donating community. 
6. All participants should be paid for donating their samples to a biobank. 
7. To me, religious communities need to be consulted about genetic and biobank research. 
8. Genetic information is different from health information. 
9. It is always permissible to do research on my personally identifiable sample without my prior permission.  
10. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government. 
11. The priority for healthcare should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
12. There is no point in consulting the public about ethical issues in science and technology.
13. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.  
14. Biobanks need independent review boards to determine who should have access to samples. 
15. Educating people about health issues (e.g. diet and lifestyle changes) promises greater health effects than investing in biobanks.
16. I trust researchers to control access to my personal samples.
17. Biobanks will only lead to expensive treatments and high profits. 
18. The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  
19. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
20. My personal sample should never be anonymized since I should be informed of important research results.  
21. If someone is a carrier of a genetic disease, they have a responsibility to participate in genetic research.
22. Participants should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at anytime. 
23. Sampling some people in an ethnocultural community is acceptable only if the whole ethnocultural community has agreed to participate.
24. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health.
25. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies.
26. There is no risk to the participants who donate to biobanks.
27. I should have property rights to my tissues before or after they leave my body.
28. Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.
29. Aboriginal communities require special consideration concerning healthcare and research.
30. Genetic research will improve our lives.
31. Genetic studies of race on enthocultural communities will lead to the discrimination of those same enthocultural communities. 
32. Participants should be active in the set up and oversight of  biobanks. 
33. I do not care if my donated sample is connected to my name and medical information.
34. Participants should be contacted every time researchers want to use their samples for research.
35. Scientists should have access to all unidentified, personal samples for research.
36. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for bothers me. 
37. Researchers should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.  
38. Everyone should donate samples to a biobank for the benefit of everyone. ","7

1. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
2. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
3. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
4. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
5. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
6. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
7. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
8. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
9. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
10. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
11. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
12. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
13. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
14. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
15. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
16. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
17. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.

21. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
22. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
23. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
24. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.

1. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
2. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
3. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
4. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
5. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
6. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
7. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
8. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
9. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
10. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
11. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
12. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
13. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
14. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
15. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
16. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
17. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
18. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
19. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
20. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
21. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
22. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
23. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
24. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
25. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
26. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
27. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
28. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
29. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.

## [Considerations]:
1. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
2. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
3. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
4. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
5. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
6. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
7. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
8. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
9. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
10. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
11. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
12. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
13. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
14. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
15. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
16. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
17. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
18. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
19. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
20. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
21. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
22. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
23. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
24. Food waste is a major environmental issue
25. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
26. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
27. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
28. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
29. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
30. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste","1. 5

7. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
8. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
9. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
10. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
11. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
12. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
13. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
14. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
15. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
16. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
17. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
18. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
19. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
20. Food waste is a major environmental issue
21. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy

24. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
25. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
26. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
27. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
28. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
29. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture

1. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
2. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
3. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
4. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
5. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
6. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
7. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
8. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
9. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
10. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
11. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
12. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
13. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
14. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
15. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
16. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
17. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
18. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.

28. It is certain that climate change exists.
29. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
30. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.

## [Considerations]:
1. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
2. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
3. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
4. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
5. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
6. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
7. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
8. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
9. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
10. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
11. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
12. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
13. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.

1. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
2. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
3. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
4. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
5. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
6. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
7. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
8. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
9. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
10. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.

15. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
16. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
17. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
18. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
19. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.

## [Considerations]:
1. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
2. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
3. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
4. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
5. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
6. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
7. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
8. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
9. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
10. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
11. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
12. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
13. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
14. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
15. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
16. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
17. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
18. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
19. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
20. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
21. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
22. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
23. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
24. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
25. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
26. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
27. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
28. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
29. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
30. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
31. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
32. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
33. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
34. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
35. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
36. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
37. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
38. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
39. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
40. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
41. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
42. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
43. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
44. Genetic research will improve our lives.
45. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
46. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
47. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
48. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.

## [Considerations]:
1. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
2. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
3. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
4. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
5. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
6. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
7. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
8. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
9. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
10. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
11. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
12. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
13. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
14. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
15. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
16. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
17. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
18. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
19. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
20. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
21. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
22. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
23. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
24. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
25. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
26. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
27. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
28. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
29. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
30. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
31. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
32. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.","7

1. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
2. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
3. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
4. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
5. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
6. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
7. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
8. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
9. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
10. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
11. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
12. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
13. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
14. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
15. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
16. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
17. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
18. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
19. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
20. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
21. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
22. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
23. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
24. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
25. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
26. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
27. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
28. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
29. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.

## [Considerations]:
1. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
2. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
3. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
4. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
5. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
6. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
7. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
8. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
9. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
10. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
11. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
12. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
13. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
14. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
15. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
16. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
17. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
18. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
19. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
20. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
21. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
22. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
23. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
24. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
25. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
26. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
27. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
28. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
29. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
30. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
31. It is certain to say that climate change exists.

3. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
4. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
5. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
6. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
7. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
8. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
9. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.

## [Considerations]:
1. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
2. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
3. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
4. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
5. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
6. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
7. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
8. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
9. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
10. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
11. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
12. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
13. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
14. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
15. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
16. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
17. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
18. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
19. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
20. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
21. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
22. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
23. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
24. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
25. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
26. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
27. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
28. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
29. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
30. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
31. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
32. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
33. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
34. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
35. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
36. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
37. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
38. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
39. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
40. Genome editing is really cool science.
41. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
42. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
43. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
44. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
45. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. ","2. 7

1. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
2. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
3. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
4. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
5. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
6. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
7. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
8. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
9. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
10. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
11. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
12. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
13. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
14. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
15. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
16. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
17. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
18. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
19. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
20. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
21. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
22. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
23. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
24. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
25. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
26. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
27. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
28. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
29. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
30. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
31. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
32. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
33. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
34. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
35. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
36. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
37. Genome editing is really cool science.
38. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
39. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
40. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
41. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
42. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
43. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
44. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.

## [Considerations]:
1. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
2. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
3. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
4. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
5. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
6. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
7. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
8. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
9. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
10. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
11. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
12. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
13. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
14. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
15. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
16. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
17. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
18. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
19. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
20. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
21. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
22. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
23. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
24. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
25. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
26. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
27. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
28. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
29. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
30. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
31. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
32. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
33. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
34. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
35. Genome editing is really cool science.
36. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
37. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
38. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
39. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
40. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
41. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
42. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
43. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
44. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
45. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.","6

7. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
8. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
9. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
10. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
11. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
12. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
13. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
14. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
15. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
16. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.

23. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
24. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
25. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.

## [Considerations]:
1. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
2. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
3. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
4. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
5. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
6. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
7. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
8. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
9. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
10. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
11. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
12. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
13. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
14. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
15. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
16. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
17. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
18. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
19. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
20. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
21. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
22. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
23. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
24. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
25. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
26. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
27. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
28. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
29. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
30. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
31. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
32. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
33. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
34. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals.
