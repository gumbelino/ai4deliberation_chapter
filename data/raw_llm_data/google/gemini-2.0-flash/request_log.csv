1. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
2. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
3. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
4. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
5. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
6. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
7. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
8. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
9. People get the government they deserve
10. I'm always cynical about government processes.
11. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
12. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
13. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
14. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
15. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
16. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
17. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
18. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
19. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
20. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
21. We live in a great democracy.
22. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
23. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
24. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
25. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
26. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
27. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
28. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
29. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
30. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
31. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
32. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
33. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
34. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
35. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
36. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
37. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
38. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
39. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
40. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
41. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
42. We are a democratic country.
43. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
44. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
45. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
46. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.

## [Considerations]:
1. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
2. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
3. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
4. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
5. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
6. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
7. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
8. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
9. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
10. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
11. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
12. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
13. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
14. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
15. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
16. I'm always cynical about government processes.
17. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
18. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
19. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
20. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
21. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
22. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
23. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
24. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
25. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
26. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
27. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
28. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
29. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
30. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
31. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
32. We are a democratic country.
33. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
34. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
35. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
36. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
37. People get the government they deserve
38. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
39. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
40. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
41. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
42. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
43. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
44. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
45. We live in a great democracy.
46. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
47. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
48. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
2. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
3. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
4. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
5. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
6. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
7. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
8. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
9. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
10. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
11. We are a democratic country.
12. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
13. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
14. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
15. We live in a great democracy.
16. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
17. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
18. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
19. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
20. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
21. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
22. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
23. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
24. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
25. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
26. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
27. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
28. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
29. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
30. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
31. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
32. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
33. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
34. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
35. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
36. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
37. People get the government they deserve
38. I'm always cynical about government processes.
39. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
40. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
41. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
42. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
43. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
44. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
45. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
46. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
47. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
48. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
2. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
3. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
4. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
5. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
6. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
7. We live in a great democracy.
8. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
9. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
10. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
11. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
12. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
13. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
14. We are a democratic country.
15. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
16. I'm always cynical about government processes.
17. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
18. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
19. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
20. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
21. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
22. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
23. People get the government they deserve
24. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
25. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
26. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
27. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
28. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
29. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
30. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
31. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
32. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
33. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
34. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
35. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
36. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
37. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
38. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
39. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
40. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
41. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
42. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
43. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
44. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
45. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
46. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
47. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
48. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.","1. 6

14. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
15. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
16. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
17. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
18. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
19. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
20. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries.

1. We can adapt to the coming changes.
2. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
3. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
4. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
5. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
6. I care about the planet.
7. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
8. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
9. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
10. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
11. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
12. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
13. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
14. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
15. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
16. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
17. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
18. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
19. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
20. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
21. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
22. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
23. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
24. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
25. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
26. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
27. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
28. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
29. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
30. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
31. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.

## [Considerations]:
1. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
2. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
3. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
4. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
5. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
6. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
7. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
8. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
9. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
10. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
11. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
12. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
13. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
14. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
15. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
16. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
17. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
18. Forest health means jobs.
19. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
20. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
21. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
22. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
23. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
24. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
25. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
26. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
27. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
28. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
29. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
30. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
31. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
32. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
33. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
34. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
35. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
36. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
37. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
38. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
39. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
40. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
41. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
42. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
43. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
44. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
45. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. ","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
2. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
3. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
4. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
5. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
6. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
7. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
8. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
9. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
10. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
11. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
12. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
13. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
14. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
15. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
16. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
17. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
18. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
19. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
20. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
21. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
22. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
23. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
24. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
25. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
26. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
27. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
28. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
29. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
30. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
31. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
32. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
33. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
34. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
35. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
36. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
37. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
38. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
39. Forest health means jobs.
40. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
41. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
42. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
43. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
44. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.

## [Considerations]:
1. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
2. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
3. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
4. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
5. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
6. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
7. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
8. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
9. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
10. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
11. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
12. Forest health means jobs.
13. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
14. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
15. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
16. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
17. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
18. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
19. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
20. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
21. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
22. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
23. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
24. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
25. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
26. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
27. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
28. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
29. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
30. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
31. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
32. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
33. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
34. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
35. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
36. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
37. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
38. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
39. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
40. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
41. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
42. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
43. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
44. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
45. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. ","1. 9

7. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
8. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
9. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
10. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
11. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
12. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
13. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
14. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
15. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
16. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
17. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
18. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
19. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
20. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
21. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
22. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.

## [Considerations]:
1. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
2. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
3. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
4. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
5. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
6. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
7. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
8. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
9. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
10. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
11. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
12. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
13. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
14. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
15. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
16. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
17. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
18. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
19. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
20. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
21. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
22. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
23. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
24. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
25. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
26. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
27. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.

## [Considerations]:
1. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
2. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
3. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
4. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
5. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
6. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
7. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
8. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
9. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
10. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
11. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
12. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
13. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
14. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
15. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
16. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
17. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
18. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
19. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
20. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
21. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
22. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
23. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
24. Food waste is a major environmental issue
25. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
26. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
27. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
28. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
29. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
30. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste","1. 4

2. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
3. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
4. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
5. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
6. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
7. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
8. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
9. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
10. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
11. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
12. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
13. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
14. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
15. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
16. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
17. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
18. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.

24. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
25. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
26. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
27. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
28. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
29. It is certain to say that climate change exists.

1. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
2. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
3. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
4. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
5. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
6. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
7. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
8. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
9. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
10. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
11. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
12. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
13. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
14. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
15. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
16. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
17. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
18. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
19. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
20. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
21. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.

8. The main concern is to have a bridge that underpins the economic activities in the region.
9. It is most important that the solution is a long term one.
10. The problem is not the vulnerable structure of the bridge but excessive traffic, which should be reduced.
11. Alterations will lead to nothing but the uglification of the bridge.
12. Altering or replacing the existing Fremantle Bridge means diminishing Fremantle.

3. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
4. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
5. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
6. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
7. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
8. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
9. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
10. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.

17. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.

## [Considerations]:
1. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
2. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
3. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
4. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
5. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
6. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
7. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
8. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
9. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
10. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
11. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
12. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
13. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
14. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
15. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
16. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
17. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
18. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
19. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
20. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.","1. 7

## [Policies]:
1. There are enough mental health services in Switzerland, and funding should remain as it is.
2. Initiatives focused on improving the socioeconomic conditions of disadvantaged people should be implemented to address mental health disparities.
3. Private mental health clinics should receive more government funding to allow more people to access them.
4. There should be more public awareness campaigns that empower people to seek mental health support and destigmatize help-seeking behaviors.
5. There should be more integrated mental health clinics that provide a range of services, such as sports or artistic activities in addition to therapy and medication
6. There are not enough mental health services in Switzerland, so their funding should be increased.

## [Considerations]:
1. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
2. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
3. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
4. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
5. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
6. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
7. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
8. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
9. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
10. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
11. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
12. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
13. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
14. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
15. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
16. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
17. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
18. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
19. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
20. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
21. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
22. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
23. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
24. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
25. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
26. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
27. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
28. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
29. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
30. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
31. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
32. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
33. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
34. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
35. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
36. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
37. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
38. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
39. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
40. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
2. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
3. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
4. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
5. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
6. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
7. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
8. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
9. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
10. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
11. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
12. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
13. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
14. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
15. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
16. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
17. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
18. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
19. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
20. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
21. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
22. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
23. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
24. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
25. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
26. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
27. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
28. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
29. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
30. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
31. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
32. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
33. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
34. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
35. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
36. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
37. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
38. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
39. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
40. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
41. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
42. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
43. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
2. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
3. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
4. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
5. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
6. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
7. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
8. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
9. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
10. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
11. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
12. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
13. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
14. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
15. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
16. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
17. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
18. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
19. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
20. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
21. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
22. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
23. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
24. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
25. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
26. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
27. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
28. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
29. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
30. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
31. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
32. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
33. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
34. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
35. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
36. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
37. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
38. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
39. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
40. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
41. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics

## [Considerations]:
1. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
2. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
3. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
4. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
5. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
6. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
7. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
8. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
9. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
10. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
11. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
12. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
13. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
14. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
15. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
16. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
17. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
18. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
19. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
20. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
21. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
22. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
23. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
24. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
25. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
26. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
27. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
28. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
29. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
30. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
31. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
32.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
33. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
34. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
35. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
36. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
37. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
38. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
39. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
40. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
41. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
42. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
43. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
44. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
45. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. ","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
2. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
3. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
4. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
5. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
6. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
7. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
8. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
9. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
10. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
11. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
12. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
13. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
14. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
15.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
16. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
17. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
18. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
19. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
20. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
21. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
22. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
23. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
24. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
25. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
26. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
27. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
28. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
29. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
30. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
31. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
32. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
33. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
34. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
35. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
36. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
37. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
38. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
39. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
40. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
41. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
42. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
43. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
44. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.

## [Considerations]:
1. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
2. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
3. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
4. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
5. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
6. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
7. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
8. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
9. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
10. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
11. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
12. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
13. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
14. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
15. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
16. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
17. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
18. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
19. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
20. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
21. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
22. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
23. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
24. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
25. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
26. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
27. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
28. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
29. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
30. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
31. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
32. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
33. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
34. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
35. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
36. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
37. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
38. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
39. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
40. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
41. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
42. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
43.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
44. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
45. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.","1. 9

1. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
2. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
3. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
4. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
5. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
6. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
7. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
8. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
9. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities
10. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
11. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
12. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
13. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
14. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
15. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
16. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
17. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
18. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
19. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
20. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
21. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
22. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.
23. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.
24. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
25. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
26. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
27. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
28. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
29. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
30. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
31. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
32. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
33. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
34. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
35. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process

## [Considerations]:
1. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
2. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
3. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
4. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
5. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
6. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
7. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
8. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
9. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
10. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
11. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
12. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
13. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
14. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
15. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
16. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
17. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
18. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
19. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
20. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
21. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
22. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
23. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
24. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
25. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
26. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
27. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
28. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
29. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
30. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
31. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
32. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
33. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
34. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
35. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
2. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
3. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
4. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
5. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
6. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
7. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
8. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
9. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
10. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
11. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
12. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
13. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
14. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
15. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
16. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
17. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
18. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
19. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
20. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
21. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
22. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
23. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
24. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
25. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
26. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
27. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
28. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
29. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
30. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
31. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
32. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
33. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
34. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.

## [Considerations]:
1. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
2. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
3. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
4. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
5. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
6. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
7. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
8. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
9. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
10. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
11. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
12. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
13. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
14. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
15. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
16. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
17. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
18. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
19. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
20. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
21. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
22. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
23. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
24. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
25. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
26. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
27. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
28. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
29. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
30. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
31. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
32. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
33. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.

1. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
2. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
3. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
4. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
5. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
6. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
7. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
8. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
9. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
10. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
11. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
12. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
13. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
14. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
15. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
16. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
17. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
18. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
19. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
20. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
21. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
22. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
23. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
24. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
25. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
26. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
27. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
28. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
29. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
30. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
31. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
32. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
33. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
34. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.

36. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
37. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
38. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
39. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
40. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
41. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.

## [Considerations]:
1. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
2. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
3. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
4. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
5. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
6. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
7. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
8. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
9. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
10. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
11. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
12. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
13. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
14. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
15. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
16. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
17. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
18. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
19. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
20. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
21. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
22. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
23. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
24. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
25. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
26. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
27. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
28. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
29. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
30. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
31. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
32. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
33. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
34. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
35. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
36. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
37. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
38. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
39. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
40. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
41. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
42. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
43. Genome editing is really cool science.
44. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.

## [Considerations]:
1. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
2. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
3. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
4. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
5. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
6. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
7. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
8. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.

5. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
6. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
7. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
8. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.

10. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
11. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
12. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.

## [Considerations]:
1. In deciding on what to do with the Bloomfield Track I don't know whether it's more important to meet the needs of the community or the environment.
2. I don't like how development is creeping further and further North into the Daintree and beyond because of its effect on the environment.
3. Whilst impacts on locals in the Bloomfield area are a concern, it is the broader community that should carry more weight when deciding what to do with the Bloomfield Track.
4. The protection of plants and animals in the Daintree is OK so long as it doesn't affect me.
5. The Bloomfield Track may not have been the best idea, but I guess there is probably little point in closing it now that it has been built.
6. Laying bitumen on the Bloomfield Track would be beneficial for the environment
7. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track does not cause siltation or damage to the fringing inshore reefs between Cape Tribulation and Cooktown
8. No development should be permitted in World Heritage areas such as the Daintree.
9. Economic development associated with the Bloomfield Track will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
10. I don't know what the people of Bloomfield think about the Bloomfield Track.
11. If future generations could have their say about the Bloomfield track, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
12. I would be worse off if more of the Daintree rainforest is protected.
13. When it comes to the Bloomfield Track, it's not important to worry about what the future will hold
14. A long term perspective on the Bloomfield Track is essential.
15. The most important use of the Bloomfield Track is for tourism.
16. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track is permanently damaging the coral reefs that fringe the beaches below
17. If we don't take steps to protect the Daintree Rainforest future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the area as we do now.
18. I'm concerned that I will be made worse off by any decision about the Bloomfield Track.
19. The more that it is possible for the average North Queensland resident can access the Bloomfield Track the better
20. Native animals in the Daintree need protection because they have a right to life which cannot be traded against economic considerations.
21. Any decision about the Bloomfield Track will greatly affect people like me.
22. The Wujal Wujal Community is better off now that the Bloomfield Track has been built.
23. Using cars on the Bloomfield Track is bad for the rainforest.
24. The fate of the Bloomfield Track is of no concern to me.
25. The Bloomfield Track issue is important for Queensland.
26. The road is just the 'thin edge of the wedge'. This may not happen for a long time, but it will happen.
27. I think that both short and long term perspectives are needed in deciding what should be done with the Bloomfield Track, but I don't know which one is more important.
28. There is no reason to believe that the Daintree Rainforest is under threat.
29. Conservation in the Daintree area is worthwhile at whatever cost.
30. Everyone in Queensland is better off for having a road like the Bloomfield Track.
31. When it comes to the Bloomfield track, people living in Cairns are in no position to judge what the interests of the local residents of Bloomfield are.
32. The future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by everyone and not just by those who live in the Bloomfield area.
33. I don't know how, but I think that there must be some way in which everybody benefits from protecting the rainforest near the Bloomfield Track.
34. I don't really know who benefits most from the protection of Rainforest in the Daintree.
35. I have no idea what the people in the Bloomfield area think about the Bloomfield Track.
36. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Daintree region because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
37. Let's fix the problems in the Daintree just for now. The future will take care of itself.
38. I'm not sure if the future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by locals, outsiders or both.
39. The Bloomfield Track is important because it allows quick access to remote areas of the North.
40. If the Bloomfield Track is sealed (bitumenized) there will not be a rapid increase in environmentally damaging development in the Daintree area in the future It may even benefit the environment there.
41. The coral reefs along the foreshore below the Bloomfield Track are not badly affected by the road.
42. I don't know if improving the Bloomfield Track would lead to a rapid acceleration of development in the area to the detriment of the environment.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
2. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
3. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
4. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
5. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
6. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
7. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
8. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
9. People get the government they deserve
10. I'm always cynical about government processes.
11. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
12. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
13. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
14. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
15. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
16. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
17. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
18. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
19. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
20. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
21. We live in a great democracy.
22. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
23. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
24. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
25. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
26. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
27. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
28. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
29. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
30. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
31. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
32. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
33. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
34. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
35. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
36. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
37. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
38. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
39. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
40. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
41. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
42. We are a democratic country.
43. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
44. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
45. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
46. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
47. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
48. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.","1. 8

16. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
17. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.

29. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
30. People get the government they deserve
31. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
32. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
33. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.

46. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.

4. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
5. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.

13. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
14. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
15. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
16. I'm always cynical about government processes.
17. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.

## [Considerations]:
1. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
2. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
3. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
4. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
5. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
6. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
7. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
8. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
9. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
10. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
11. We are a democratic country.
12. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
13. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
14. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
15. We live in a great democracy.
16. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
17. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
18. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
19. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
20. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
21. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
22. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
23. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
24. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
25. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
26. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
27. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
28. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
29. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
30. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
31. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
32. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
33. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
34. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
35. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
36. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
37. People get the government they deserve
38. I'm always cynical about government processes.
39. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
40. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
41. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
42. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
43. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
44. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
45. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.

## [Considerations]:
1. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
2. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
3. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
4. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
5. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
6. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
7. We live in a great democracy.
8. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
9. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
10. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
11. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
12. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
13. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
14. We are a democratic country.
15. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
16. I'm always cynical about government processes.
17. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
18. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
19. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
20. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
21. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
22. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
23. People get the government they deserve
24. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
25. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
26. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
27. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
28. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
29. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
30. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
31. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
32. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
33. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
34. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
35. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
36. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
37. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
38. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
39. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
40. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
41. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
42. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
43. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
44. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
45. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
46. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
47. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
48. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.","1. 6

6. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
7. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
8. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
9. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
10. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.

13. We can adapt to the coming changes.
14. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
15. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
16. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
17. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
18. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
19. I care about the planet.
20. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
21. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
22. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
23. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
24. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
25. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
26. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
27. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
28. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.

## [Considerations]:
1. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
2. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
3. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
4. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
5. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
6. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
7. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
8. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
9. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
10. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
11. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
12. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
13. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
14. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
15. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
16. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
17. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
18. Forest health means jobs.
19. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
20. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
21. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
22. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
23. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
24. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
25. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
26. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
27. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
28. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
29. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
30. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
31. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
32. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
33. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
34. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
35. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
36. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
37. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
38. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
39. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
40. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
41. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
42. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
43. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
44. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
45. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. ","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
2. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
3. Forest health means jobs.
4. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
5. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
6. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
7. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
8. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
9. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
10. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
11. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
12. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
13. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
14. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
15. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
16. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
17. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
18. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
19. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
20. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
21. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
22. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
23. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
24. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
25. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
26. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
27. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
28. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
29. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
30. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
31. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
32. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
33. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
34. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
35. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
36. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
37. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
38. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
39. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
40. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
41. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
42. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
43. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
44. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
45. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.","1. 7

2. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
3. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
4. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
5. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
6. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
7. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
8. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
9. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
10. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
11. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
12. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
13. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
14. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
15. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
16. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
17. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
18. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
19. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
20. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
21. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
22. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
23. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
24. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
25. Forest health means jobs.
26. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
27. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
28. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
29. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
30. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
31. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
32. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
33. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
34. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
35. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
36. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
37. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
38. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
39. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
40. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
41. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
42. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
43. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
44. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
45. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.","1. 3

2. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
3. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management.

8. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
9. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
10. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
11. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
12. Forest health means jobs.
13. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
14. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
15. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
16. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
17. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
18. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
19. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science.

22. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
23. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.

30. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
31. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
32. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
33. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
34. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
35. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
36. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
37. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
38. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
39. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
40. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.

1. It is always permissible to do research on my personally identifiable sample without my prior permission.  
2. Participants who donate their samples for research should be given special access to the treatments and therapies that result from that research. 
3. Genetic information is different from health information. 
4. Participants should be contacted every time researchers want to use their samples for research.
5. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.  
6. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government. 
7. If someone is a carrier of a genetic disease, they have a responsibility to participate in genetic research.
8. Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.
9. There is no point in consulting the public about ethical issues in science and technology.
10. Aboriginal communities require special consideration concerning healthcare and research.
11. Policy makers should consider the possibility that Canada should not pursue biobanking.
12. There is no risk to the participants who donate to biobanks.
13. Participants should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at anytime. 
14. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies.
15. The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  
16. I trust researchers to control access to my personal samples.
17. Genetic research will improve our lives.
18. Educating people about health issues (e.g. diet and lifestyle changes) promises greater health effects than investing in biobanks.
19. I should have property rights to my tissues before or after they leave my body.
20. Biobanks need independent review boards to determine who should have access to samples. 
21. Scientists should have access to all unidentified, personal samples for research.
22. The priority for healthcare should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
23. Sampling some people in an ethnocultural community is acceptable only if the whole ethnocultural community has agreed to participate.
24. Everyone should donate samples to a biobank for the benefit of everyone. 
25. I do not care if my donated sample is connected to my name and medical information.
26. All participants should be paid for donating their samples to a biobank. 
27. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health.
28. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
29. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
30. Biobanks will only lead to expensive treatments and high profits. 
31. Researchers should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.  
32. Participants should be active in the set up and oversight of  biobanks. 
33. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for bothers me. 
34. Genetic studies of disability will lead to the discrimination of people living with the same conditions.
35. To me, religious communities need to be consulted about genetic and biobank research. 
36. Profits from biobanking should be returned to the donating community. 
37. Genetic studies of race on enthocultural communities will lead to the discrimination of those same enthocultural communities. 
38. My personal sample should never be anonymized since I should be informed of important research results.  ","1. 1

## [Considerations]:
1. Participants who donate their samples for research should be given special access to the treatments and therapies that result from that research. 
2. Policy makers should consider the possibility that Canada should not pursue biobanking.
3. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
4. Genetic studies of disability will lead to the discrimination of people living with the same conditions.
5. Profits from biobanking should be returned to the donating community. 
6. All participants should be paid for donating their samples to a biobank. 
7. To me, religious communities need to be consulted about genetic and biobank research. 
8. Genetic information is different from health information. 
9. It is always permissible to do research on my personally identifiable sample without my prior permission.  
10. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government. 
11. The priority for healthcare should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
12. There is no point in consulting the public about ethical issues in science and technology.
13. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.  
14. Biobanks need independent review boards to determine who should have access to samples. 
15. Educating people about health issues (e.g. diet and lifestyle changes) promises greater health effects than investing in biobanks.
16. I trust researchers to control access to my personal samples.
17. Biobanks will only lead to expensive treatments and high profits. 
18. The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  
19. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
20. My personal sample should never be anonymized since I should be informed of important research results.  
21. If someone is a carrier of a genetic disease, they have a responsibility to participate in genetic research.
22. Participants should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at anytime. 
23. Sampling some people in an ethnocultural community is acceptable only if the whole ethnocultural community has agreed to participate.
24. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health.
25. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies.
26. There is no risk to the participants who donate to biobanks.
27. I should have property rights to my tissues before or after they leave my body.
28. Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.
29. Aboriginal communities require special consideration concerning healthcare and research.
30. Genetic research will improve our lives.
31. Genetic studies of race on enthocultural communities will lead to the discrimination of those same enthocultural communities. 
32. Participants should be active in the set up and oversight of  biobanks. 
33. I do not care if my donated sample is connected to my name and medical information.
34. Participants should be contacted every time researchers want to use their samples for research.
35. Scientists should have access to all unidentified, personal samples for research.
36. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for bothers me. 
37. Researchers should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.  
38. Everyone should donate samples to a biobank for the benefit of everyone. ","1. 2

7. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
8. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
9. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.

2. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
3. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
4. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
5. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
6. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
7. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
8. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
9. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
10. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
11. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
12. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
13. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
14. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
15. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
16. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
17. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
18. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
19. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.

2. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
3. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
4. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
5. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
6. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
7. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
8. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
9. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
10. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
11. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
12. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
13. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
14. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
15. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
16. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
17. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
18. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
19. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
20. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
21. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
22. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
23. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
24. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
25. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
26. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
27. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
28. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
29. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
30. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).

## [Considerations]:
1. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
2. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
3. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
4. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
5. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
6. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
7. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
8. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
9. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
10. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
11. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
12. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
13. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
14. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
15. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
16. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
17. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
18. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
19. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
20. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
21. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
22. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
23. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
24. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
25. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
26. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
27. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
28. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
29. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
30. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.

2. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
3. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
4. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
5. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
6. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
7. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
8. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
9. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
10. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
11. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
12. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
13. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
14. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
15. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
16. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
17. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
18. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
19. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
20. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
21. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
22. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
23. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
24. Food waste is a major environmental issue
25. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
26. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
27. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
28. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
29. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
30. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste","1. 4

5. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
6. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
7. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
8. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
9. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
10. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics

## [Considerations]:
1. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
2. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
3. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
4. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
5. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
6. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
7. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
8. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
9. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
10. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
11. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
12. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
13. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
14. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
15. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
16. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
17. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
18. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
19. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
20. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
21. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
22. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
23. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
24. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
25. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
26. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
27. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
28. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
29. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.

1. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
2. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
3. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
4. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
5. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
6. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
7. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
8. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
9. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
10. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
11. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
12. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
13. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
14. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
15. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
16. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
17. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
18. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
19. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
20. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
21. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
22. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
23. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
24. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).

2. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
3. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
4. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
5. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
6. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
7. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
8. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
9. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
10. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
11. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
12. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
13. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
14. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
15. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
16. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
17. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
18. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
19. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
20. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
21. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
22. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
23. It is certain that climate change exists.
24. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
25. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
26. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
27. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
28. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
29. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
30. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
31. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
32. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.

8. The main concern is to have a bridge that underpins the economic activities in the region.
9. It is most important that the solution is a long term one.
10. The problem is not the vulnerable structure of the bridge but excessive traffic, which should be reduced.
11. Alterations will lead to nothing but the uglification of the bridge.
12. Altering or replacing the existing Fremantle Bridge means diminishing Fremantle.

21. The most important issue for cyclists is safety, which means they need access across the bridge which has a good surface.
22. When deciding about the future of the bridge, indigenous concerns should be given adequate consideration. 
23. Indigenous people would want to minimize impact on the Swan River, a registered site, that is of importance and significance to them.
24. We shouldn't stick to the past when deciding about the future of the bridge, we should be open for modern design options.
25. There are no specific economic benefits for the Fremantle from the bridge.
26. The critical infrastructure of the bridge raises serious safety concerns. 
27. The Fremantle Bridge is irreplaceable. It is a strong, enduring part of our history.

2. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
3. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
4. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
5. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
6. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
7. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
8. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
9. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
10. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
11. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
12. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
13. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
14. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
15. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
16. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
17. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
18. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
19. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
20. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.","1. 7

1. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
2. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
3. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
4. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
5. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
6. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
7. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
8. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
9. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
10. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
11. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
12. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
13. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
14. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
15. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
16. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
17. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
18. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
19. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
20. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
21. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
22. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
23. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
24. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
25. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
26. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
27. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
28. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
29. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
30. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
31. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
32. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
33. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
34. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
35. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
36. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
37. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
38. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
39. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
40. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
41. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.

3. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
4. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
5. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
6. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
7. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
8. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
9. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
10. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
11. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
12. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
13. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
14. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
15. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
16. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
17. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
18. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
19. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
20. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
21. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
22. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
23. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
24. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
25. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
26. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
27. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
28. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
29. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
30. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
31. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
32. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
33. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
34. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
35. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
36. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
37. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
38. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
39. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
40. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.

## [Considerations]:
1. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
2. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
3. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
4. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
5. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
6. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
7. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
8. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
9. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
10. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
11. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
12. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
13. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
14. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
15. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
16. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
17. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
18. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
19. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
20. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
21. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
22. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
23. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
24. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
25. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
26. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
27. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
28. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
29. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
30. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
31. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
32. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
33. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
34. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
35. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
36. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
37. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
38. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
39. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
40. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
41. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
42. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
43. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
2. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
3. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
4. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
5. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
6. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
7. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
8. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
9. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
10. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
11. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
12. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
13. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
14. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
15. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
16. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
17. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
18. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
19. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
20. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
21. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
22. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
23. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
24. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
25. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
26. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
27. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
28. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
29. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
30. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
31. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
32.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
33. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
34. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
35. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
36. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
37. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
38. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
39. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
40. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
41. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
42. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
43. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
44. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
45. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. ","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
2. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
3. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
4. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
5. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
6. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
7. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
8. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
9. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
10. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
11.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
12. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
13. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
14. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
15. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
16. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
17. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
18. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
19. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
20. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
21. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
22. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
23. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
24. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
25. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
26. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
27. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
28. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
29. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
30. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
31. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
32. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
33. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
34. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
35. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
36. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
37. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
38. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
39. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
40. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
41. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
42. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
43. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
44. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
45. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
2. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
3. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
4. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
5. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
6. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
7. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
8. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
9. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
10. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
11. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
12. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
13. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
14. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
15. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
16. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
17. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
18. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
19. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
20. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
21. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
22. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
23. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
24. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
25. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
26. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
27. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
28. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
29. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
30. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
31. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
32. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
33. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
34. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
35. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
36. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
37. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
38. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
39. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
40. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
41. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
42. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
43.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
44. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
45. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
2. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
3. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
4. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
5. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
6. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
7. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
8. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
9. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
10. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
11. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
12. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
13. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
14. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
15. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
16. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
17. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
18. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
19. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
20. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
21. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
22. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
23. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
24. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
25. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
26. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
27. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
28. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
29. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
30. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
31. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
32. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
33. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
34. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
35. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.","1. 7

21. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
22. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
23. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
24. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
25. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
26. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
27. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
28. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
29. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
30. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
31. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
32. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
33. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
34. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
35. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.","1. 1

1. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
2. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
3. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
4. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
5. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
6. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
7. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
8. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
9. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
10. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
11. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
12. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
13. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
14. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
15. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
16. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
17. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
18. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
19. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
20. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
21. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
22. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
23. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
24. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
25. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
26. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
27. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
28. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
29. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
30. Genome editing is really cool science.
31. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
32. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
33. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
34. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
35. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
36. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
37. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
38. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
39. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
40. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
41. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
42. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
43. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
44. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.

## [Considerations]:
1. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
2. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
3. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.

6. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
7. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
8. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
9. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
10. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
11. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.

## [Considerations]:
1. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
2. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
3. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
4. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
5. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
6. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
7. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
8. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
9. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
10. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
11. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
12. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
13. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
14. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
15. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
16. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
17. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
18. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
19. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
20. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
21. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.

10. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
11. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
12. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
13. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
14. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
15. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
16. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
17. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
18. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
19. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
20. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
21. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
22. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
23. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results

25. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
26. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
27. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
28. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
29. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
30. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.

8. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
9. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
10. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.

19. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
20. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
21. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
22. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
23. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
24. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
25. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
26. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
27. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
28. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
29. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
30. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
31. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
32. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
33. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
34. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
35. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
36. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
37. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
38. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
39. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
40. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
41. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
42. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
43. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
44. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
45. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.

## [Considerations]:
1. In deciding on what to do with the Bloomfield Track I don't know whether it's more important to meet the needs of the community or the environment.
2. I don't like how development is creeping further and further North into the Daintree and beyond because of its effect on the environment.
3. Whilst impacts on locals in the Bloomfield area are a concern, it is the broader community that should carry more weight when deciding what to do with the Bloomfield Track.
4. The protection of plants and animals in the Daintree is OK so long as it doesn't affect me.
5. The Bloomfield Track may not have been the best idea, but I guess there is probably little point in closing it now that it has been built.
6. Laying bitumen on the Bloomfield Track would be beneficial for the environment
7. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track does not cause siltation or damage to the fringing inshore reefs between Cape Tribulation and Cooktown
8. No development should be permitted in World Heritage areas such as the Daintree.
9. Economic development associated with the Bloomfield Track will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
10. I don't know what the people of Bloomfield think about the Bloomfield Track.

18. I'm concerned that I will be made worse off by any decision about the Bloomfield Track.
19. The more that it is possible for the average North Queensland resident can access the Bloomfield Track the better
20. Native animals in the Daintree need protection because they have a right to life which cannot be traded against economic considerations.
21. Any decision about the Bloomfield Track will greatly affect people like me.
22. The Wujal Wujal Community is better off now that the Bloomfield Track has been built.
23. Using cars on the Bloomfield Track is bad for the rainforest.
24. The fate of the Bloomfield Track is of no concern to me.
25. The Bloomfield Track issue is important for Queensland.
26. The road is just the 'thin edge of the wedge'. This may not happen for a long time, but it will happen.
27. I think that both short and long term perspectives are needed in deciding what should be done with the Bloomfield Track, but I don't know which one is more important.
28. There is no reason to believe that the Daintree Rainforest is under threat.
29. Conservation in the Daintree area is worthwhile at whatever cost.
30. Everyone in Queensland is better off for having a road like the Bloomfield Track.
31. When it comes to the Bloomfield track, people living in Cairns are in no position to judge what the interests of the local residents of Bloomfield are.

35. I have no idea what the people in the Bloomfield area think about the Bloomfield Track.
36. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Daintree region because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
37. Let's fix the problems in the Daintree just for now. The future will take care of itself.
38. I'm not sure if the future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by locals, outsiders or both.
39. The Bloomfield Track is important because it allows quick access to remote areas of the North.
40. If the Bloomfield Track is sealed (bitumenized) there will not be a rapid increase in environmentally damaging development in the Daintree area in the future It may even benefit the environment there.
41. The coral reefs along the foreshore below the Bloomfield Track are not badly affected by the road.
42. I don't know if improving the Bloomfield Track would lead to a rapid acceleration of development in the area to the detriment of the environment.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
2. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
3. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
4. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
5. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
6. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
7. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
8. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
9. People get the government they deserve
10. I'm always cynical about government processes.
11. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
12. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
13. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
14. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
15. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
16. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
17. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
18. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
19. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
20. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
21. We live in a great democracy.
22. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
23. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
24. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
25. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
26. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
27. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
28. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
29. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
30. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
31. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
32. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
33. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
34. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
35. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
36. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
37. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
38. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
39. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
40. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
41. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
42. We are a democratic country.
43. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
44. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
45. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
46. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
47. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
48. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
2. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
3. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
4. We live in a great democracy.
5. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
6. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
7. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
8. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
9. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
10. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
11. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
12. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
13. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
14. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
15. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
16. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
17. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
18. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
19. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
20. I'm always cynical about government processes.
21. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
22. We are a democratic country.
23. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
24. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
25. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
26. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
27. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
28. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
29. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
30. People get the government they deserve
31. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
32. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
33. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
34. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
35. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
36. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
37. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
38. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
39. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
40. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
41. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
42. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
43. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
44. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
45. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
46. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
47. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
48. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.","1. 9

6. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
7. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
8. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
9. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
10. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
11. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
12. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
13. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
14. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
15. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
16. I'm always cynical about government processes.
17. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
18. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
19. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
20. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
21. People get the government they deserve
22. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
23. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
24. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
25. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
26. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
27. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
28. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
29. We are a democratic country.
30. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
31. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
32. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
33. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
34. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
35. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
36. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
37. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
38. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
39. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
40. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
41. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
42. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
43. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
44. We live in a great democracy.
45. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
46. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
47. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.

26. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
27. I'm always cynical about government processes.
28. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
29. We live in a great democracy.
30. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
31. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
32. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
33. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
34. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
35. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
36. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
37. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
38. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
39. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
40. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
41. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
42. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
43. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
44. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
45. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
46. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
47. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.

## [Considerations]:
1. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
2. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
3. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
4. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
5. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
6. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
7. We live in a great democracy.
8. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
9. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
10. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
11. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
12. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
13. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
14. We are a democratic country.
15. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
16. I'm always cynical about government processes.
17. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
18. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
19. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
20. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
21. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
22. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
23. People get the government they deserve
24. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
25. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
26. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
27. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
28. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
29. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
30. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
31. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
32. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
33. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
34. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
35. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
36. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
37. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
38. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
39. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
40. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
41. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
42. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
43. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
44. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
45. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
46. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
47. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market

14. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
15. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
16. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
17. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
18. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
19. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
20. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
21. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
22. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.

## [Considerations]:
1. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
2. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
3. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
4. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
5. I care about the planet.
6. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
7. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
8. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
9. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
10. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
11. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
12. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
13. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
14. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
15. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
16. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
17. We can adapt to the coming changes.
18. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
19. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
20. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
21. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
22. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
23. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
24. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
25. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
26. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
27. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
28. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
29. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
30. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
31. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
32. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
33. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
2. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
3. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
4. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
5. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
6. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
7. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
8. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
9. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
10. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
11. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
12. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
13. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
14. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
15. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
16. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
17. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
18. Forest health means jobs.
19. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
20. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
21. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
22. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
23. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
24. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
25. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
26. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
27. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
28. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
29. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
30. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
31. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
32. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.

## [Considerations]:
1. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
2. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
3. Forest health means jobs.
4. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
5. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
6. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
7. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
8. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
9. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
10. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
11. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
12. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
13. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
14. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
15. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
16. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
17. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
18. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
19. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
20. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
21. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
22. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
23. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
24. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
25. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
26. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
27. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
28. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
29. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
30. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
31. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
32. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
33. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
34. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
35. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
36. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
37. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
38. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
39. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
40. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
41. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
42. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
43. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
44. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
45. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
2. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
3. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
4. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
5. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
6. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
7. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
8. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
9. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
10. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
11. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
12. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
13. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
14. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
15. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
16. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
17. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
18. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
19. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
20. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
21. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
22. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
23. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
24. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
25. Forest health means jobs.
26. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
27. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
28. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
29. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
30. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
31. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
32. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
33. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
34. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
35. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
36. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
37. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
38. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
39. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
40. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
41. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
42. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
43. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
44. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
45. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.","1. 3

42. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
43. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.

1. It is always permissible to do research on my personally identifiable sample without my prior permission.  
2. Participants who donate their samples for research should be given special access to the treatments and therapies that result from that research. 
3. Genetic information is different from health information. 
4. Participants should be contacted every time researchers want to use their samples for research.
5. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.  
6. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government. 
7. If someone is a carrier of a genetic disease, they have a responsibility to participate in genetic research.
8. Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.
9. There is no point in consulting the public about ethical issues in science and technology.
10. Aboriginal communities require special consideration concerning healthcare and research.
11. Policy makers should consider the possibility that Canada should not pursue biobanking.
12. There is no risk to the participants who donate to biobanks.
13. Participants should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at anytime. 
14. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies.
15. The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  
16. I trust researchers to control access to my personal samples.
17. Genetic research will improve our lives.
18. Educating people about health issues (e.g. diet and lifestyle changes) promises greater health effects than investing in biobanks.
19. I should have property rights to my tissues before or after they leave my body.
20. Biobanks need independent review boards to determine who should have access to samples. 
21. Scientists should have access to all unidentified, personal samples for research.
22. The priority for healthcare should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
23. Sampling some people in an ethnocultural community is acceptable only if the whole ethnocultural community has agreed to participate.
24. Everyone should donate samples to a biobank for the benefit of everyone. 
25. I do not care if my donated sample is connected to my name and medical information.
26. All participants should be paid for donating their samples to a biobank. 
27. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health.
28. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
29. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
30. Biobanks will only lead to expensive treatments and high profits. 
31. Researchers should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.  
32. Participants should be active in the set up and oversight of  biobanks. 
33. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for bothers me. 
34. Genetic studies of disability will lead to the discrimination of people living with the same conditions.
35. To me, religious communities need to be consulted about genetic and biobank research. 
36. Profits from biobanking should be returned to the donating community. 
37. Genetic studies of race on enthocultural communities will lead to the discrimination of those same enthocultural communities. 
38. My personal sample should never be anonymized since I should be informed of important research results.  ","1. 1

3. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
4. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
5. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
6. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
7. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
8. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
9. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
10. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
11. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
12. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
13. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
14. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
15. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
16. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
17. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
18. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.

5. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
6. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
7. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
8. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
9. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
10. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
11. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
12. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
13. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
14. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
15. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
16. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
17. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
18. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
19. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
20. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
21. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
22. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
23. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.

1. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
2. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
3. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.

5. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
6. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
7. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
8. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
9. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
10. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
11. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
12. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
13. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
14. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
15. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
16. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
17. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
18. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
19. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
20. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
21. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
22. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
23. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
24. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
25. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
26. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
27. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
28. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.

1. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
2. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
3. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
4. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
5. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
6. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
7. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
8. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
9. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
10. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
11. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
12. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
13. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
14. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
15. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
16. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
17. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
18. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
19. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
20. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
21. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
22. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
23. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
24. Food waste is a major environmental issue
25. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
26. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them

5. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
6. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
7. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
8. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
9. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
10. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
11. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
12. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy

15. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
16. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
17. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
18. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
19. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.

11. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
12. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
13. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
14. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
15. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
16. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
17. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
18. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
19. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
20. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
21. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
22. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
23. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
24. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
25. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
26. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
27. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
28. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
29. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
30. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality","1. 3

1. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
2. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
3. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
4. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
5. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
6. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
7. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
8. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
9. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
10. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
11. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
12. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
13. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
14. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
15. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
16. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
17. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
18. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
19. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
20. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
21. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
22. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
23. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
24. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
25. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
26. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
27. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
28. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
29. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.

8. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
9. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
10. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
11. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
12. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
13. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
14. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
15. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
16. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.

2. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
3. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
4. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
5. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
6. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
7. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
8. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
9. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
10. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
11. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
12. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
13. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
14. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
15. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
16. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
17. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
18. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
19. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
20. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.

## [Considerations]:
1. Reducing the risk of vessel collision on the Swan River should be the main consideration when deciding about the future of the bridge
2. The safety of the bridge is more important than its appearance.
3. River craft deserve better traffic conditions on the Swan River.
4. This magnificent timber bridge is a rare and beautiful sight in today's world, it should be preserved. 
5. Any changes to the bridge should give right consideration to the environment.bridge
6. We just got traffic calming in Town Centre after 25 years effort. I don't want bridge to be build bigger, better faster to reverse the gains of the last 25 years.
7. Providing a better pedestrian and cycle traffic should be the main consideration when deciding about the future of the bridge.
8. The main concern is to have a bridge that underpins the economic activities in the region.
9. It is most important that the solution is a long term one.
10. The problem is not the vulnerable structure of the bridge but excessive traffic, which should be reduced.
11. Alterations will lead to nothing but the uglification of the bridge.
12. Altering or replacing the existing Fremantle Bridge means diminishing Fremantle.
13. Tax payers money should be spent on services that are more essential than upgrading the bridge.
14. The bridge is certainly an attractive entry statement to Fremantle and without doubt far more important than trucks.
15. The function of the Fremantle Bridge as a transport gateway is more important than its heritage.
16. Whatever works are undertaken, the heritage value of the old bridge will be affected.
17. The most important thing is that access to Fremantle from its north is maintained in the most undisturbed manner as possible. 
18. We should definitely preserve the heritage value of the bridge, but only if it is financially viable.
19. Replacing timber elements with steel components would destroy the authentic appearance of the bridge.
20. The existing bridge is too low; archways too narrow and do not line up with the railway bridge making navigation dangerous. 
21. The most important issue for cyclists is safety, which means they need access across the bridge which has a good surface.
22. When deciding about the future of the bridge, indigenous concerns should be given adequate consideration. 
23. Indigenous people would want to minimize impact on the Swan River, a registered site, that is of importance and significance to them.

1. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
2. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
3. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
4. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
5. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
6. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
7. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
8. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
9. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
10. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
11. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
12. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
13. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
14. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
15. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
16. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
17. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
18. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
19. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
20. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
21. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
22. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
23. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
24. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
25. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
26. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
27. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
28. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
29. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
30. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
31. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
32. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
33. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
34. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
35. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
36. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
37. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
38. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
39. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
40. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
41. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.

30. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
31. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
32. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
2. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
3. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
4. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
5. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
6. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
7. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
8. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
9. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
10. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
11. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
12. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
13. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
14. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
15. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
16. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
17. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
18. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
19. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
20. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
21. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
22. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
23. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
24. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
25. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
26. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
27. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
28. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
29. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
30. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
31. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
32. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
33. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
34. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
35. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
36. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
37. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
38. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
39. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
40. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
41. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
42. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
43. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
2. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
3. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
4. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
5. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
6. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
7. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
8. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
9. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
10. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
11. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
12. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
13. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
14. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
15. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
16. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
17. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
18. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
19. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
20. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
21. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
22. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
23. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
24. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
25. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
26. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
27. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
28. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
29. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
30. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
31. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
32.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
33. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
34. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
35. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
36. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
37. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
38. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
39. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
40. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
41. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
42. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
43. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
44. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
45. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. ","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
2. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
3. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
4. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
5. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
6. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
7. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
8. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
9. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
10. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
11.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
12. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
13. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
14. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
15. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
16. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
17. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
18. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
19. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
20. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
21. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
22. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
23. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
24. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
25. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
26. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
27. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
28. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
29. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
30. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
31. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
32. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
33. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
34. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
35. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
36. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
37. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
38. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
39. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
40. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
41. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
42. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
43. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
44. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
45. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.","1. 9

1. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
2. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
3. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
4. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
5. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
6. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
7. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
8. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
9. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
10. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
11. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
12. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
13. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
14. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
15. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
16. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
17. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
18. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
19. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
20. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
21. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
22. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
23. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
24. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
25. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
26. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
27. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
28. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
29. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
30. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
31. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
32. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
33. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
34. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.

36. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
37. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
38. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
39. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
40. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts.

## [Considerations]:
1. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
2. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
3. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
4. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
5. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
6. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
7. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
8. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
9. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
10. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
11. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
12. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
13. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
14. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
15. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
16. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
17. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
18. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
19. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
20. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
21. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
22. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
23. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
24. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
25. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
26. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
27. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
28. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
29. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
30. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
31. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
32. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
33. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
34. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
35. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.","1. 7

10. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
11. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
12. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
13. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
14. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
15. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
16. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
17. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
18. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
19. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
20. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
21. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
22. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
23. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
24. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
25. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
26. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
27. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
28. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
29. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
30. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
31. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
32. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
33. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
34. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does.

13. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
14. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
15. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
16. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
17. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
18. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
19. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
20. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
21. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
22. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
23. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
24. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
25. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
26. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
27. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
28. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
29. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
30. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
31. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
32. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
33. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
34. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
35. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.","1. 1

1. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
2. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
3. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
4. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
5. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
6. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
7. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
8. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
9. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
10. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
11. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
12. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
13. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
14. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
15. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
16. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
17. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
18. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
19. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
20. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
21. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
22. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
23. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
24. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
25. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
26. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
27. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
28. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
29. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
30. Genome editing is really cool science.
31. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
32. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
33. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
34. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
35. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
36. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
37. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
38. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
39. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
40. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
41. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.

## [Considerations]:
1. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
2. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
3. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
4. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
5. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
6. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
7. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
8. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
9. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
10. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
11. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
12. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
13. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
14. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
15. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
16. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
17. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
18. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
19. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
20. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
21. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
22. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.

## [Considerations]:
1. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
2. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
3. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
4. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
5. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
6. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
7. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
8. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
9. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
10. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
11. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
12. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
13. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
14. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
15. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
16. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
17. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
18. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
19. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
20. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.

1. Encouraging more personal responsibility by abolishing mandatory health insurance and increasing out-of-pocket payments.
2. A universal, public, and unified healthcare system, where people pay according to their income, would ensure healthcare access for everyone.
3. No changes are needed to the current healthcare system, as it functions well as it is.
4. Fixing financial inefficiencies in the healthcare system could save a lot of money without major changes to the system.
5. More government control over pricing and greater financial support (e.g., individual premium subsidies) would help those in need.

## [Considerations]:
1. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
2. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
3. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
4. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
5. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
6. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
7. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
8. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
9. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
10. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
11. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
12. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
13. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
14. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
15. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
16. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
17. Genetic research will improve our lives.
18. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
19. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
20. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
21. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
22. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
23. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
24. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
25. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
26. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
27. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
28. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
29. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
30. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
31. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
32. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
33. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
34. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
35. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
36. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
37. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
38. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
39. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
40. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
41. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
42. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
43. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
44. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body

23. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
24. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
25. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
26. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
27. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
28. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
29. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
30. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
31. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
32. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
33. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
34. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples

38. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
39. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
40. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
41. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
42. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
43. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
44. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
45. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
46. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.

1. Privately Funded with strong regulation: A BB system where funding is provided mostly by private companies, withstrong government oversight and privacy provisions.
2. High Privacy: Implementation of a (publicy or privately owned) biobanking system where privacy of individuals is paramount. Stored data and biological samples for research requires the authorization of individual donors.
3. Publicly Funded with minimal regulation: A biobanking system owned and run by the government, who is also responsible for oversight and privacy provisions, as well as controlling access.
4. Cautious Implementation: Minimal input of public resources to development biobanking Use resources  — use instead for other approaches to improving health. Very strict oversight of use of biobanks and strong privacy provisions.
