cuid,created_at,provider,model,temperature,input_tokens,output_tokens,C1. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.,C2. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.,C3. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.,C4. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.,C5. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.,"C6. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.",C7. Townsville is better off because of mining development.,"C8. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.",C9. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.,C10. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.,C11. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.,C12. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.,C13. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.,"C14. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.","C15. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.",C16. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.,C17. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. ,C18. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.,C19. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.,"C20. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.","C21. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.",C22. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.,C23. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.,C24. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.,C25. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.,C26. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.,C27. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. ,"C28. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.",C29. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. ,C30. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change ,"C31. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. ",C32. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. ,C33. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.,C34. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. ,C35. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
