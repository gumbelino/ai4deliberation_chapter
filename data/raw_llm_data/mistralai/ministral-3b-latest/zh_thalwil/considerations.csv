It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.,C4. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.,C5. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.,C6. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.,C7. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.,"C8. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.","C9. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.",C10. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.,C11. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.,C12. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.,C13. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.,C14. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.,C15. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.,"C16.

The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.,C23.

It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.,C29. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.,C30. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.,"C31. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change."
