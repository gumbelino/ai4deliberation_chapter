The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.,C3. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.,C4. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.,C5. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.,C6. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.,C7. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies,C8. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.,C9.

Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.,C11. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.,C12. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.,C13. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.,"C14. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.",C15. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.,C16. Genetic research will improve our lives.,C17. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.,C18. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.,C19. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.,C20. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results,C21. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.,C22. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research,C23. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.,C24.

I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.",C34. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples,C35. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.,C36. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.,C37. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.,C38. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.,"C39.

I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples,C43. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.,C44.
