Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.",C2. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.,C3.

The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.",C19. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.,C20. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.,"C21. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.",C22. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.,"C23. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.",C24. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
