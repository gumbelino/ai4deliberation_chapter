## [Considerations]:
1. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
2. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
3. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
4. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
5. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
6. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
7. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
8. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
9. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
10. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
11. People get the government they deserve
12. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
13. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
14. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
15. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
16. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
17. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
18. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
19. I'm always cynical about government processes.
20. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
21. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
22. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
23. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
24. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
25. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
26. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
27. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
28. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
29. We live in a great democracy.
30. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
31. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
32. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
33. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
34. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
35. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
36. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
37. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
38. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
39. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
40. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
41. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
42. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
43. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
44. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
45. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
46. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
47. We are a democratic country.
48. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.","1. 8

1. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
2. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
3. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
4. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
5. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
6. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
7. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
8. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
9. We can adapt to the coming changes.
10. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
11. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
12. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
13. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
14. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
15. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
16. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
17. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
18. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
19. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
20. I care about the planet.
21. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
22. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
23. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
24. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
25. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
26. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
27. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
28. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
29. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
30. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
31. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.

23. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
24. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
25. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
26. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
27. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
28. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
29. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
30. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
31. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
32. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
33. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.","1. 11

## [Considerations]:
1. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
2. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
3. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
4. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
5. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
6. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
7. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
8. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
9. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
10. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
11. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
12. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
13. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
14. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
15. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
16. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
17. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
18. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
19. Forest health means jobs.
20. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
21. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
22. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
23. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
24. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
25. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
26. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
27. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
28. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
29. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
30. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
31. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
32. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
33. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
34. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
35. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
36. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
37. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
38. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
39. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
40. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
41. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
42. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
43. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
44. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat.

10. All participants should be paid for donating their samples to a biobank. 
11. Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.
12. Genetic studies of disability will lead to the discrimination of people living with the same conditions.
13. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies.

16. I do not care if my donated sample is connected to my name and medical information.
17. There is no risk to the participants who donate to biobanks.
18. My personal sample should never be anonymized since I should be informed of important research results.  
19. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
20. Educating people about health issues (e.g. diet and lifestyle changes) promises greater health effects than investing in biobanks.
21. The priority for healthcare should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
22. The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  
23. Participants who donate their samples for research should be given special access to the treatments and therapies that result from that research. 
24. Policy makers should consider the possibility that Canada should not pursue biobanking.
25. It is always permissible to do research on my personally identifiable sample without my prior permission.  
26. Researchers should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.  
27. Biobanks need independent review boards to determine who should have access to samples. 
28. I trust researchers to control access to my personal samples.
29. Genetic research will improve our lives.
30. To me, religious communities need to be consulted about genetic and biobank research. 
31. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health.
32. Participants should be contacted every time researchers want to use their samples for research.
33. Participants should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at anytime. 
34. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.  
35. Participants should be active in the set up and oversight of  biobanks. 
36. Profits from biobanking should be returned to the donating community.

## [Considerations]:
1. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
2. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.  
3. Educating people about health issues (e.g. diet and lifestyle changes) promises greater health effects than investing in biobanks.
4. Genetic studies of race on enthocultural communities will lead to the discrimination of those same enthocultural communities. 
5. Scientists should have access to all unidentified, personal samples for research.
6. Sampling some people in an ethnocultural community is acceptable only if the whole ethnocultural community has agreed to participate.
7. Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.
8. Profits from biobanking should be returned to the donating community. 
9. Aboriginal communities require special consideration concerning healthcare and research.
10. Policy makers should consider the possibility that Canada should not pursue biobanking.
11. To me, religious communities need to be consulted about genetic and biobank research. 
12. Genetic research will improve our lives.
13. It is always permissible to do research on my personally identifiable sample without my prior permission.  
14. The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  
15. My personal sample should never be anonymized since I should be informed of important research results.  
16. Biobanks need independent review boards to determine who should have access to samples. 
17. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
18. Participants should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at anytime. 
19. I trust researchers to control access to my personal samples.
20. I do not care if my donated sample is connected to my name and medical information.
21. Everyone should donate samples to a biobank for the benefit of everyone. 
22. Genetic studies of disability will lead to the discrimination of people living with the same conditions.
23. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies.
24. Participants who donate their samples for research should be given special access to the treatments and therapies that result from that research. 
25. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health.
26. The priority for healthcare should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
27. Researchers should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.  
28. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government. 
29. If someone is a carrier of a genetic disease, they have a responsibility to participate in genetic research.
30. All participants should be paid for donating their samples to a biobank. 
31. Participants should be active in the set up and oversight of  biobanks. 
32. Genetic information is different from health information. 
33. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for bothers me. 
34. There is no risk to the participants who donate to biobanks.
35. Participants should be contacted every time researchers want to use their samples for research.
36. I should have property rights to my tissues before or after they leave my body.
37. There is no point in consulting the public about ethical issues in science and technology.
38. Biobanks will only lead to expensive treatments and high profits. ","1. 11

## [Considerations]:
1. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
2. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
3. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
4. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
5. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
6. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
7. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
8. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
9. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
10. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
11. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
12. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
13. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
14. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
15. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
16. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
17. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
18. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
19. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
20. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
21. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
22. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
23. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
24. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
25. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
26. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
27. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
28. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
29. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
30. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
31. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.","1. 2

1. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
2. Food waste is a major environmental issue
3. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
4. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
5. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
6. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
7. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
8. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
9. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
10. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
11. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
12. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
13. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
14. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
15. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
16. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
17. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
18. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
19. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
20. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
21. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
22. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
23. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
24. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
25. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
26. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture

1. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
2. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
3. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
4. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
5. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
6. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
7. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
8. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
9. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
10. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
11. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
12. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
13. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
14. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
15. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
16. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
17. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
18. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.

## [Considerations]:
1. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
2. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
3. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
4. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
5. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
6. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
7. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
8. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
9. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
10. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
11. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
12. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
13. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
14. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
15. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
16. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
17. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
18. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
19. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
20. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
21. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
22. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
23. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
24. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
25. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
26. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
27. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
28. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
29. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
30. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
31. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
32. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
33. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
34. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
35. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
36. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
37. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
38. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
39. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
40. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
41. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
42. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
43. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
2. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
3. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
4. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
5. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
6. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
7. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
8.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
9. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
10. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
11. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
12. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
13. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
14. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
15. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
16. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
17. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
18. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
19. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
20. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
21. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
22. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
23. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
24. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
25. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
26. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
27. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
28. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
29. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
30. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
31. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
32. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
33. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
34. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
35. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
36. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
37. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
38. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
39. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
40. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
41. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
42. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
43. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
44. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
45. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.
2. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.
3. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
4. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
5. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities
6. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process
7. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
8. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
9. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
10. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
11. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
12. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
13. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
14. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
15. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
16. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
17. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
18. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
19. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
20. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
21. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
22. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
23. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
24. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
25. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
26. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
27. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
28. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
29. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
30. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
31. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
32. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
33. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
34. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
35. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
36. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.","1. 4

8. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
9. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
10. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
11. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
12. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
13. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities
14. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
15. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
16. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
17. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
18. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
19. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
20. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
21. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
22. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.
23. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
24. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process
25. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
26. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
27. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
28. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.
29. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
30. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
31. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
32. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
33. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
34. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
35. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
36. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union","1. 1

1. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
2. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
3. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
4. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
5. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
6. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
7. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
8. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
9. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
10. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
11. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
12. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
13. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
14. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
15. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
16. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
17. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
18. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
19. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
20. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
21. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
22. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
23. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
24. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
25. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
26. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
27. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
28. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
29. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
30. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
31. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
32. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.

1. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
2. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
3. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
4. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
5. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
6. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
7. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
8. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
9. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
10. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
11. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
12. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
13. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
14. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
15. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
16. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
17. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
18. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
19. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
20. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
21. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
22. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
23. Genome editing is really cool science.
24. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
25. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
26. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
27. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
28. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
29. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
30. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
31. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
32. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
33. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
34. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
35. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
36. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
37. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
38. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
39. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
40. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
41. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
42. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
43. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
44. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
45. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
2. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
3. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
4. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
5. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
6. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
7. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
8. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
9. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
10. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.

3. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
4. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
5. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
6. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
7. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
8. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
9. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
10. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
11. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
12. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
13. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
14. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
15. Genetic research will improve our lives.
16. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
17. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
18. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
19. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
20. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
21. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
22. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
23. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
24. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
25. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
26. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
27. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
28. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
29. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
30. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
31. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
32. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
33. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
34. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
35. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
36. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
37. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
38. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
39. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
40. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
41. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
42. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
43. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
44. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
45. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
46. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
47. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
48. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
49. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
2. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
3. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
4. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
5. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
6. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
7. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
8. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
9. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
10. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
11. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
12. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
13. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
14. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
15. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
16. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
17. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
18. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
19. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
20. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
21. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
22. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
23. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
24. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
25. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
26. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
27. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
28. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
29. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
30. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
31. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
32. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
33. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
34. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
35. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
36. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
37. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
38. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
39. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
40. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
41. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
42. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
43. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
44. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
45. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
46. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
47. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
48. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
49. Genetic research will improve our lives.","1. 7

4. Cautious Implementation: Minimal input of public resources to development biobanking Use resources  — use instead for other approaches to improving health. Very strict oversight of use of biobanks and strong privacy provisions.
5. Privately Funded with minimal regulation: Minimal regulation of privately run biobanking system with maximum participation of the public. Low privacy provisions.

## [Considerations]:
1. The road is just the 'thin edge of the wedge'. This may not happen for a long time, but it will happen.
2. Economic development associated with the Bloomfield Track will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
3. The coral reefs along the foreshore below the Bloomfield Track are not badly affected by the road.
4. Native animals in the Daintree need protection because they have a right to life which cannot be traded against economic considerations.
5. When it comes to the Bloomfield Track, it's not important to worry about what the future will hold
6. If we don't take steps to protect the Daintree Rainforest future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the area as we do now.
7. When it comes to the Bloomfield track, people living in Cairns are in no position to judge what the interests of the local residents of Bloomfield are.
8. Whilst impacts on locals in the Bloomfield area are a concern, it is the broader community that should carry more weight when deciding what to do with the Bloomfield Track.
9. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track does not cause siltation or damage to the fringing inshore reefs between Cape Tribulation and Cooktown
10. In deciding on what to do with the Bloomfield Track I don't know whether it's more important to meet the needs of the community or the environment.
11. I'm not sure if the future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by locals, outsiders or both.
12. No development should be permitted in World Heritage areas such as the Daintree.
13. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track is permanently damaging the coral reefs that fringe the beaches below
14. A long term perspective on the Bloomfield Track is essential.
15. Everyone in Queensland is better off for having a road like the Bloomfield Track.
16. I don't like how development is creeping further and further North into the Daintree and beyond because of its effect on the environment.
17. The Bloomfield Track is important because it allows quick access to remote areas of the North.
18. Using cars on the Bloomfield Track is bad for the rainforest.
19. If future generations could have their say about the Bloomfield track, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
20. I don't know what the people of Bloomfield think about the Bloomfield Track.
21. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Daintree region because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
22. The Bloomfield Track issue is important for Queensland.
23. I don't know if improving the Bloomfield Track would lead to a rapid acceleration of development in the area to the detriment of the environment.
24. The Bloomfield Track may not have been the best idea, but I guess there is probably little point in closing it now that it has been built.
25. Conservation in the Daintree area is worthwhile at whatever cost.
26. The fate of the Bloomfield Track is of no concern to me.
27. Any decision about the Bloomfield Track will greatly affect people like me.
28. The Wujal Wujal Community is better off now that the Bloomfield Track has been built.
29. I think that both short and long term perspectives are needed in deciding what should be done with the Bloomfield Track, but I don't know which one is more important.
30. The future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by everyone and not just by those who live in the Bloomfield area.
31. If the Bloomfield Track is sealed (bitumenized) there will not be a rapid increase in environmentally damaging development in the Daintree area in the future It may even benefit the environment there.
32. I would be worse off if more of the Daintree rainforest is protected.
33. I have no idea what the people in the Bloomfield area think about the Bloomfield Track.
34. There is no reason to believe that the Daintree Rainforest is under threat.
35. Laying bitumen on the Bloomfield Track would be beneficial for the environment
36. The more that it is possible for the average North Queensland resident can access the Bloomfield Track the better
37. I don't really know who benefits most from the protection of Rainforest in the Daintree.
38. Let's fix the problems in the Daintree just for now. The future will take care of itself.
39. The most important use of the Bloomfield Track is for tourism.
40. I don't know how, but I think that there must be some way in which everybody benefits from protecting the rainforest near the Bloomfield Track.
41. I'm concerned that I will be made worse off by any decision about the Bloomfield Track.
42. The protection of plants and animals in the Daintree is OK so long as it doesn't affect me.","1. 6

1. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
2. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
3. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
4. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
5. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
6. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
7. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
8. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
9. People get the government they deserve
10. I'm always cynical about government processes.
11. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
12. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
13. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
14. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
15. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
16. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
17. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
18. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
19. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
20. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
21. We live in a great democracy.
22. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
23. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
24. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
25. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
26. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
27. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
28. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
29. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
30. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
31. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
32. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
33. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
34. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
35. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
36. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
37. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
38. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
39. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
40. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
41. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
42. We are a democratic country.
43. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
44. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
45. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
46. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
47. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
48. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.","1. 6

22. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
23. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
24. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
25. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
26. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
27. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.

30. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
31. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
32. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
33. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
34. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
35. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
36. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
37. We are a democratic country.
38. We live in a great democracy.
39. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
40. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
41. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.

43. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
44. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
45. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
46. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
47. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.

3. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
4. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
5. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
6. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
7. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
8. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
9. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
10. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
11. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
12. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
13. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
14. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
15. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
16. I'm always cynical about government processes.
17. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
18. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
19. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
20. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
21. People get the government they deserve
22. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
23. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
24. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
25. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
26. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
27. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
28. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
29. We are a democratic country.
30. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
31. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
32. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
33. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
34. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
35. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
36. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
37. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
38. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
39. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
40. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
41. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
42. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
43. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
44. We live in a great democracy.
45. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
46. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
47. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.

## [Considerations]:
1. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
2. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
3. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
4. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
5. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
6. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
7. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
8. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
9. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
10. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
11. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
12. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
13. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
14. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
15. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
16. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
17. People get the government they deserve
18. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
19. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
20. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
21. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
22. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
23. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
24. We are a democratic country.
25. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
26. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
27. I'm always cynical about government processes.
28. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
29. We live in a great democracy.
30. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
31. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
32. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
33. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
34. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
35. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
36. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
37. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
38. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
39. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
40. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
41. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
42. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
43. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
44. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
45. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
46. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
47. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.

1. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
2. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
3. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
4. I care about the planet.
5. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
6. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
7. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
8. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
9. We can adapt to the coming changes.
10. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
11. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
12. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
13. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
14. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
15. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
16. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
17. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
18. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
19. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
20. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
21. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
22. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
23. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
24. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
25. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
26. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
27. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
28. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
29. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
30. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
31. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
32. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
33. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.","1. 10

## [Considerations]:
1. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
2. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
3. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
4. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
5. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
6. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
7. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
8. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
9. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
10. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
11. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
12. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
13. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
14. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
15. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
16. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
17. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
18. Forest health means jobs.
19. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
20. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
21. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
22. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
23. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
24. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
25. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
26. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
27. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
28. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
29. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
30. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
31. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
32. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
33. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
34. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
35. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
36. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
37. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
38. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
39. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
40. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
41. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
42. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
43. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
44. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
45. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. ","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
2. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
3. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
4. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
5. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
6. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
7. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
8. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
9. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
10. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
11. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
12. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
13. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
14. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
15. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
16. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
17. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
18. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
19. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
20. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
21. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
22. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
23. Forest health means jobs.
24. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
25. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
26. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
27. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
28. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
29. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
30. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
31. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
32. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
33. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
34. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
35. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
36. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
37. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
38. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
39. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
40. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
41. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
42. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
43. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
44. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
45. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. ","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
2. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
3. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
4. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
5. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
6. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
7. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
8. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
9. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
10. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
11. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
12. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
13. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
14. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
15. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
16. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
17. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
18. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
19. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
20. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
21. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
22. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
23. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
24. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
25. Forest health means jobs.
26. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
27. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
28. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
29. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
30. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
31. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
32. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
33. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
34. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
35. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
36. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
37. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
38. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
39. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
40. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
41. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
42. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
43. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
44. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.

4. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
5. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
6. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
7. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
8. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
9. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
10. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.

1. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
2. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
3. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
4. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
5. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
6. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
7. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
8. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
9. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
10. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
11. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
12. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
13. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
14. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
15. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
16. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
17. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
18. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
19. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
20. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
21. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
22. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
23. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
24. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
25. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
26. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
27. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
28. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.

## [Considerations]:
1. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
2. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
3. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
4. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
5. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
6. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
7. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
8. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
9. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
10. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
11. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
12. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
13. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
14. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
15. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
16. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
17. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
18. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
19. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
20. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
21. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
22. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
23. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
24. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
25. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
26. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
27. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
28. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
29. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.

## [Considerations]:
1. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
2. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
3. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
4. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
5. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
6. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
7. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
8. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
9. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
10. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
11. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
12. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
13. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
14. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
15. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
16. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
17. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
18. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
19. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
20. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
21. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
22. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
23. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
24. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
25. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
26. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
27. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
28. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
29. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
30. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
31. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
2. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
3. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
4. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
5. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
6. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
7. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
8. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
9. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
10. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
11. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
12. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
13. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
14. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
15. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
16. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
17. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
18. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
19. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
20. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
21. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
22. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
23. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
24. Food waste is a major environmental issue
25. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
26. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
27. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
28. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
29. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?

1. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
2. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
3. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
4. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
5. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
6. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
7. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
8. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
9. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
10. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
11. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
12. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
13. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
14. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
15. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
16. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
17. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
18. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
19. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
20. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
21. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
22. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
23. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
24. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.

2. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
3. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
4. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
5. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
6. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
7. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
8. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
9. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
10. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
11. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
12. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
13. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
14. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
15. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
16. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
17. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
18. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
19. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
20. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
21. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
22. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.

1. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
2. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
3. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
4. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
5. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
6. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
7. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
8. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
9. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
10. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
11. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
12. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
13. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
14. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
15. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
16. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
17. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
18. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
19. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
20. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
21. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
22. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
23. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
24. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
25. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
26. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
27. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
28. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
29. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
30. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
31. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.

## [Considerations]:
1. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
2. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
3. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
4. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
5. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
6. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
7. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
8. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
9. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
10. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
11. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
12. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
13. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
14. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
15. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
16. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
17. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
18. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
19. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
20. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
21. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
22. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
23. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
24. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
25. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
26. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
27. It is certain that climate change exists.
28. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
29. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
30. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
31. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
32. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
33. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
2. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
3. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
4. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
5. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
6. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
7. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
8. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
9. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
10. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
11. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
12. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
13. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
14. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
15. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
16. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
17. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
18. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
19. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
20. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
2. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
3. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
4. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
5. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
6. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
7. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
8. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
9. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
10. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
11. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
12. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
13. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
14. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
15. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
16. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
17. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
18. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
19. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.

## [Considerations]:
1. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
2. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
3. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
4. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
5. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
6. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
7. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
8. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
9. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
10. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
11. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
12. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
13. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
14. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
15. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
16. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
17. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
18. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
19. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
20. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
21. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
22. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
23. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
24. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
25. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
26. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
27. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
28. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
29. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
30. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
31. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
32. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
33. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
34. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
35. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
36. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
37. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
38. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
39. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
40. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
41. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
42. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
43. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.","1. 4

## [Considerations]:
1. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
2. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
3. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
4. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
5. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
6. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
7. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
8. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
9. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
10. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
11. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
12. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
13. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
14. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
15. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
16. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
17. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
18. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
19. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
20. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
21. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
22. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
23. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
24. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
25. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
26. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
27. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
28. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
29. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
30. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
31. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
32. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
33. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
34. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
35. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
36. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
37. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
38. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
39. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
40. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
41. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
42. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
2. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
3. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
4. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
5. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
6. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
7. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
8. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
9. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
10. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
11. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
12. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
13. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
14. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
15. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
16. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
17. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
18. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
19. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
20. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
21. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
22. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
23. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
24. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
25. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
26. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
27. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
28. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
29. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
30. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
31. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
32. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
33. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
34. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
35. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
36. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
37. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
38. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
39. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
40. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
41. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
42. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.

## [Considerations]:
1. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
2. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
3. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
4. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
5. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
6. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
7. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
8. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
9. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
10. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
11. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
12. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
13. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
14. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
15. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
16. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
17. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
18. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
19. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
20. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
21. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
22. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
23. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
24. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
25. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
26. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
27. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
28. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
29. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
30. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
31. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
32.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
33. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
34. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
35. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
36. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
37. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
38. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
39. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
40. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
41. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
42. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
43. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
44. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
45. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. ","1. 4

44. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).

## [Considerations]:
1. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
2. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
3. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
4. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
5. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
6. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
7. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
8. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
9. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
10. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
11. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
12. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
13. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
14. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
15. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
16. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
17. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
18. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
19. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
20. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
21. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
22. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
23. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
24. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
25. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
26. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
27. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
28. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
29. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
30. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
31. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
32. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
33. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
34. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
35. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
36. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
37.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
38. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
39. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
40. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
41. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
42. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
43. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
44. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
45. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
2. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
3. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
4. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
5. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
6. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
7. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
8. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
9. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
10. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
11. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
12. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
13. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
14. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
15. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
16. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
17. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
18. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
19. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
20. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
21. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
22. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
23. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
24. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
25. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
26. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
27. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
28. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
29. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
30. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
31. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
32. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
33. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
34. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
35. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
36. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
37. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
38. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
39. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
40. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
41.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
42. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
43. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
44. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
45. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
2. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
3. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.
4. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
5. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
6. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
7. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
8. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
9. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
10. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
11. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
12. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.
13. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
14. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
15. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
16. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
17. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
18. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
19. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
20. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
21. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
22. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
23. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
24. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities
25. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
26. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
27. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
28. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
29. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
30. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
31. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
32. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process
33. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
34. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
35. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
36. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.","1. 1

## [Considerations]:
1. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
2. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
3. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process
4. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
5. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.
6. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
7. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
8. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
9. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
10. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
11. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
12. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
13. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
14. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
15. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
16. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.
17. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
18. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.
19. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
20. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
21. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
22. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
23. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
24. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
25. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
26. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
27. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities
28. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
29. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
30. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
31. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
32. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
33. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
34. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
35. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
36. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
2. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
3. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
4. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
5. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
6. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
7. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
8. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
9. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
10. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
11. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
12. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
13. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
14. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
15. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
16. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
17. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
18. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
19. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
20. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
21. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
22. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
23. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
24. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
25. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
26. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
27. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
28. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
29. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
30. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
31. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
32. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
33. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
34. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.

## [Considerations]:
1. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
2. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
3. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
4. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
5. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
6. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
7. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
8. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
9. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
10. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
11. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
12. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
13. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
14. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
15. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
16. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
17. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
18. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
19. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
20. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
21. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
22. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
23. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
24. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
25. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
26. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
27. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
28. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
29. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
30. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
31. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
32. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
33. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
34. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
35. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
2. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
3. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
4. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
5. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
6. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
7. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
8. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
9. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
10. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
11. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
12. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
13. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
14. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
15. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
16. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
17. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
18. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
19. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
20. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
21. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
22. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
23. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
24. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
25. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
26. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
27. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
28. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
29. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
30. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
31. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
32. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
33. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
34. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
35. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
2. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
3. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
4. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
5. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
6. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
7. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
8. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
9. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
10. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
11. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
12. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
13. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
14. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
15. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
16. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
17. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
18. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
19. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
20. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
21. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
22. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
23. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
24. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
25. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
26. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
27. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
28. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
29. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
30. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
31. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
32. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
33. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
34. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
35. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
36. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
37. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
38. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
39. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
40. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
41. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
42. Genome editing is really cool science.
43. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
44. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
45. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
2. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
3. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
4. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
5. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
6. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
7. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
8. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
9. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
10. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
11. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
12. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
13. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
14. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
15. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
16. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
17. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
18. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
19. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
20. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
21. Genome editing is really cool science.
22. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
23. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
24. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
25. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
26. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
27. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
28. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
29. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
30. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
31. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
32. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
33. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
34. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
35. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
36. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
37. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
38. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
39. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
40. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
41. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
42. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
43. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
44. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
45. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. ","1. 5

3. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
4. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
5. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
6. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
7. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
8. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
9. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
10. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
11. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
12. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
13. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
14. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
15. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
16. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
17. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
18. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
19. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
20. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
21. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.

1. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
2. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
3. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
4. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
5. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
6. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
7. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
8. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
9. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
10. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
11. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
12. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
13. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
14. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
15. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
16. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
17. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
18. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
19. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
20. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
21. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
22. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
23. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.

## [Considerations]:
1. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
2. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
3. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
4. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
5. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
6. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
7. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
8. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
9. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
10. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
11. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
12. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
13. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
14. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
15. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
16. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
17. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
18. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
19. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
20. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
21. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.

3. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
4. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
5. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
6. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
7. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
8. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
9. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
10. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
11. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
12. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
13. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
14. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
15. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
16. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
17. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
18. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
19. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
20. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
21. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
22. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.

1. Genetic research will improve our lives.
2. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
3. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
4. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
5. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
6. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
7. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
8. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
9. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
10. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
11. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
12. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
13. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
14. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
15. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
16. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
17. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
18. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
19. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
20. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
21. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
22. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
23. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
24. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
25. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
26. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
27. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
28. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
29. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
30. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
31. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
32. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
33. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
34. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
35. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
36. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
37. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
38. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
39. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
40. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
41. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
42. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
43. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
44. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
45. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
46. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
47. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
48. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
49. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.","1. 8

19. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
20. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
21. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
22. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
23. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results

25. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
26. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
27. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
28. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
29. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
30. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
31. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
32. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
33. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.

26. No development should be permitted in World Heritage areas such as the Daintree.

1. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
2. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
3. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
4. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
5. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
6. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
7. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
8. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
9. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
10. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
11. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
12. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
13. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
14. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
15. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
16. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
17. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
18. We are a democratic country.
19. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
20. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
21. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
22. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
23. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
24. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
25. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
26. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
27. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
28. We live in a great democracy.
29. I'm always cynical about government processes.
30. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
31. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
32. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
33. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
34. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
35. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
36. People get the government they deserve
37. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
38. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
39. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
40. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
41. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
42. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
43. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
44. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
45. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
46. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
47. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
48. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
2. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
3. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
4. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
5. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
6. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
7. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
8. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
9. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
10. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
11. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
12. We live in a great democracy.
13. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
14. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
15. We are a democratic country.
16. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
17. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
18. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
19. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
20. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
21. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
22. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
23. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
24. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
25. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
26. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
27. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
28. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
29. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
30. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
31. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
32. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
33. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
34. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
35. I'm always cynical about government processes.
36. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
37. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
38. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
39. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
40. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
41. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
42. People get the government they deserve
43. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
44. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
45. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
46. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
47. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
48. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.","1. 1

1. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
2. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
3. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
4. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
5. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
6. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
7. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
8. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
9. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
10. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
11. I care about the planet.
12. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
13. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
14. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
15. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
16. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
17. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
18. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
19. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
20. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
21. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
22. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
23. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
24. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.

29. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
30. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.

## [Considerations]:
1. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
2. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
3. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
4. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
5. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
6. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
7. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
8. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
9. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
10. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
11. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
12. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
13. I care about the planet.
14. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
15. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
16. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
17. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
18. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
19. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
20. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
21. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
22. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
23. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
24. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
25. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
26. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
27. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
28. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
29. We can adapt to the coming changes.
30. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
31. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
32. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
33. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
2. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
3. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
4. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
5. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
6. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
7. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
8. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
9. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
10. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
11. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
12. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
13. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
14. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
15. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
16. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
17. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
18. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
19. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
20. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
21. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
22. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
23. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
24. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
25. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
26. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
27. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
28. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
29. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
30. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
31. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
32. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
33. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
34. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
35. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
36. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
37. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
38. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
39. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
40. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
41. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
42. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
43. Forest health means jobs.
44. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
45. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
2. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
3. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
4. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
5. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
6. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
7. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
8. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
9. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
10. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
11. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
12. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
13. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
14. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
15. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
16. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
17. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
18. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
19. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
20. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
21. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
22. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
23. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
24. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
25. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
26. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
27. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
28. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
29. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
30. Forest health means jobs.
31. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
32. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
33. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
34. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
35. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
36. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
37. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
38. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
39. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
40. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
41. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
42. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
43. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
44. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.

2. All participants should be paid for donating their samples to a biobank. 
3. Biobanks need independent review boards to determine who should have access to samples. 
4. Educating people about health issues (e.g. diet and lifestyle changes) promises greater health effects than investing in biobanks.
5. The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  
6. There is no risk to the participants who donate to biobanks.
7. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
8. Genetic research will improve our lives.
9. There is no point in consulting the public about ethical issues in science and technology.
10. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for bothers me. 
11. Genetic information is different from health information. 
12. Everyone should donate samples to a biobank for the benefit of everyone. 
13. Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.
14. Participants who donate their samples for research should be given special access to the treatments and therapies that result from that research. 
15. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies.
16. My personal sample should never be anonymized since I should be informed of important research results.  
17. Researchers should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.  
18. Profits from biobanking should be returned to the donating community. 
19. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government. 
20. Participants should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at anytime. 
21. I trust researchers to control access to my personal samples.
22. Scientists should have access to all unidentified, personal samples for research.
23. Policy makers should consider the possibility that Canada should not pursue biobanking.
24. I do not care if my donated sample is connected to my name and medical information.
25. The priority for healthcare should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
26. To me, religious communities need to be consulted about genetic and biobank research. 
27. I should have property rights to my tissues before or after they leave my body.
28. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health.
29. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.  
30. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
31. It is always permissible to do research on my personally identifiable sample without my prior permission.  
32. Genetic studies of disability will lead to the discrimination of people living with the same conditions.
33. Aboriginal communities require special consideration concerning healthcare and research.
34. Biobanks will only lead to expensive treatments and high profits. 
35. Sampling some people in an ethnocultural community is acceptable only if the whole ethnocultural community has agreed to participate.
36. Participants should be active in the set up and oversight of  biobanks. 
37. If someone is a carrier of a genetic disease, they have a responsibility to participate in genetic research.
38. Participants should be contacted every time researchers want to use their samples for research.","1. 6

1. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
2. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
3. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
4. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
5. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
6. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
7. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
8. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
9. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
10. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
11. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
12. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
13. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
14. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
15. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
16. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
17. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
18. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
19. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
20. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.

## [Considerations]:
1. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
2. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
3. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
4. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
5. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
6. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
7. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
8. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
9. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
10. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
11. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
12. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
13. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
14. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
15. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
16. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
17. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
18. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
19. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
20. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
21. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
22. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
23. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
24. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
25. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
26. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
27. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
28. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
29. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
30. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
31. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
2. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
3. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
4. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
5. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
6. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
7. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
8. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
9. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
10. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
11. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
12. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
13. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
14. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
15. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
16. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
17. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
18. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
19. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
20. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
21. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
22. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
23. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
24. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
25. Food waste is a major environmental issue
26. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
27. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
28. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products

3. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
4. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
5. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
6. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
7. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
8. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
9. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
10. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
11. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
12. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
13. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
14. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
15. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
16. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
17. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
18. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
19. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
20. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
21. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
22. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
23. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
24. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.

26. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
27. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.

## [Considerations]:
1. The most important issue for cyclists is safety, which means they need access across the bridge which has a good surface.
2. The cost of maintaining the old timber structure is too high.
3. The main concern is to have a bridge that underpins the economic activities in the region.
4. Tax payers money should be spent on services that are more essential than upgrading the bridge.
5. Whatever works are undertaken, the heritage value of the old bridge will be affected.
6. Altering or replacing the existing Fremantle Bridge means diminishing Fremantle.
7. Replacing timber elements with steel components would destroy the authentic appearance of the bridge.
8. Reducing the risk of vessel collision on the Swan River should be the main consideration when deciding about the future of the bridge
9. The Fremantle Traffic Bridge is the most iconic landmark and the main tourist attraction in Fremantle. 
10. River craft deserve better traffic conditions on the Swan River.
11. We just got traffic calming in Town Centre after 25 years effort. I don't want bridge to be build bigger, better faster to reverse the gains of the last 25 years.
12. This magnificent timber bridge is a rare and beautiful sight in today's world, it should be preserved. 
13. Indigenous people would want to minimize impact on the Swan River, a registered site, that is of importance and significance to them.
14. The most important thing is that access to Fremantle from its north is maintained in the most undisturbed manner as possible. 
15. When deciding about the future of the bridge, indigenous concerns should be given adequate consideration. 
16. The old bridge provides a scenic entrance to Fremantle that attracts tourists.
17. The existing bridge is too low; archways too narrow and do not line up with the railway bridge making navigation dangerous. 
18. Providing a better pedestrian and cycle traffic should be the main consideration when deciding about the future of the bridge.
19. The bridge is certainly an attractive entry statement to Fremantle and without doubt far more important than trucks.
20. It is most important that the solution is a long term one.
21. As long as there is a bridge that I can cross, I don't care about its structure.
22. We should definitely preserve the heritage value of the bridge, but only if it is financially viable.
23. The problem is not the vulnerable structure of the bridge but excessive traffic, which should be reduced.
24. The bridge has stood the test of time for the past 67 years; there's no need for major changes to it.
25. Any changes to the bridge should give right consideration to the environment.bridge
26. Since the traffic bridge has important heritage significance, the only grounds for its removal should be on the grounds of serious safety issues and verified by heritage engineers.
27. The old bridge will never be able to handle vehicles, bike and pedestrians at the same time.

29. The problem is not the vulnerable structure of the bridge but excessive traffic, which should be reduced.
30. Whatever works are undertaken, the heritage value of the old bridge will be affected.
31. The bridge has stood the test of time for the past 67 years; there's no need for major changes to it.
32. The Fremantle Traffic Bridge is the most iconic landmark and the main tourist attraction in Fremantle. 
33. The safety of the bridge is more important than its appearance.
34. It is worth spending money to retain the iconic status of the bridge.
35. The old bridge will never be able to handle vehicles, bike and pedestrians at the same time.

1. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.

12. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
13. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
14. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
15. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
16. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
17. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
18. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
19. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
20. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it

23. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
24. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
25. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
26. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable

29. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
30. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
31. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.

15. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
16. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
17. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
18. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
19. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
20. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
21. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
22. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
23. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
24. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
25. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
26. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
27. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
28. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
29. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
30. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
31. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
32. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
33. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
34. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
35. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
36. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
37. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.

## [Considerations]:
1. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
2. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
3. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
4. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
5. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
6. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
7. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
8. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
9. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
10. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
11. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
12. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
13. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
14. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
15. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
16. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
17. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
18. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
19. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
20. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
21. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
22. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
23. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
24. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
25. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
26. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
27. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
28. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
29. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
30. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
31. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
32. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
33. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
34.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
35. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
36. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
37. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
38. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
39. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
40. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
41. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
42. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
43. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
44. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
45. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.","1. 4

## [Considerations]:
1. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
2. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
3. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
4. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
5. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
6. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
7. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
8. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
9. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
10. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
11. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
12. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
13. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
14.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
15. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
16. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
17. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
18. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
19. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
20. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
21. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
22. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
23. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
24. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
25. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
26. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
27. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
28. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
29. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
30. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
31. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
32. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
33. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
34. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
35. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
36. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
37. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
38. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
39. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
40. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
41. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
42. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
43. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
44. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
45. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
2. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
3. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.
4. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
5. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
6. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process
7. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
8. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
9. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
10. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
11. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
12. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
13. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities
14. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
15. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
16. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
17. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
18. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
19. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
20. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
21. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
22. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.
23. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
24. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
25. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
26. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
27. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.
28. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
29. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
30. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
31. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
32. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
33. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
34. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
35. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
36. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.","1. 1

1. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
2. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
3. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
4. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
5. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
6. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
7. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
8. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
9. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
10. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
11. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
12. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
13. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
14. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
15. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
16. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
17. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
18. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
19. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
20. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
21. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
22. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
23. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
24. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
25. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
26. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
27. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
28. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
29. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
30. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
31. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
32. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
33. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
34. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.

## [Considerations]:
1. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
2. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
3. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
4. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
5. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
6. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
7. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
8. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
9. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
10. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
11. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
12. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
13. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
14. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
15. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
16. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
17. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
18. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
19. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
20. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
21. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
22. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
23. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
24. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
25. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
26. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
27. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
28. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
29. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
30. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
31. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
32. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
33. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
34. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
35. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. I'm not sure if the future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by locals, outsiders or both.
2. Using cars on the Bloomfield Track is bad for the rainforest.
3. I'm concerned that I will be made worse off by any decision about the Bloomfield Track.
4. The Wujal Wujal Community is better off now that the Bloomfield Track has been built.
5. Economic development associated with the Bloomfield Track will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
6. The future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by everyone and not just by those who live in the Bloomfield area.
7. The protection of plants and animals in the Daintree is OK so long as it doesn't affect me.
8. I don't know if improving the Bloomfield Track would lead to a rapid acceleration of development in the area to the detriment of the environment.
9. I don't really know who benefits most from the protection of Rainforest in the Daintree.
10. I have no idea what the people in the Bloomfield area think about the Bloomfield Track.
11. Native animals in the Daintree need protection because they have a right to life which cannot be traded against economic considerations.
12. The road is just the 'thin edge of the wedge'. This may not happen for a long time, but it will happen.
13. When it comes to the Bloomfield Track, it's not important to worry about what the future will hold
14. If the Bloomfield Track is sealed (bitumenized) there will not be a rapid increase in environmentally damaging development in the Daintree area in the future It may even benefit the environment there.
15. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track is permanently damaging the coral reefs that fringe the beaches below
16. Any decision about the Bloomfield Track will greatly affect people like me.
17. The Bloomfield Track issue is important for Queensland.
18. I don't know how, but I think that there must be some way in which everybody benefits from protecting the rainforest near the Bloomfield Track.
19. In deciding on what to do with the Bloomfield Track I don't know whether it's more important to meet the needs of the community or the environment.
20. I don't know what the people of Bloomfield think about the Bloomfield Track.
21. No development should be permitted in World Heritage areas such as the Daintree.
22. The Bloomfield Track is important because it allows quick access to remote areas of the North.
23. I think that both short and long term perspectives are needed in deciding what should be done with the Bloomfield Track, but I don't know which one is more important.
24. If we don't take steps to protect the Daintree Rainforest future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the area as we do now.
25. The Bloomfield Track may not have been the best idea, but I guess there is probably little point in closing it now that it has been built.
26. The more that it is possible for the average North Queensland resident can access the Bloomfield Track the better
27. Laying bitumen on the Bloomfield Track would be beneficial for the environment
28. I don't like how development is creeping further and further North into the Daintree and beyond because of its effect on the environment.
29. Everyone in Queensland is better off for having a road like the Bloomfield Track.
30. Whilst impacts on locals in the Bloomfield area are a concern, it is the broader community that should carry more weight when deciding what to do with the Bloomfield Track.
31. There is no reason to believe that the Daintree Rainforest is under threat.
32. Conservation in the Daintree area is worthwhile at whatever cost.
33. A long term perspective on the Bloomfield Track is essential.
34. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Daintree region because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
35. The fate of the Bloomfield Track is of no concern to me.
36. When it comes to the Bloomfield track, people living in Cairns are in no position to judge what the interests of the local residents of Bloomfield are.
37. If future generations could have their say about the Bloomfield track, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
38. The coral reefs along the foreshore below the Bloomfield Track are not badly affected by the road.
39. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track does not cause siltation or damage to the fringing inshore reefs between Cape Tribulation and Cooktown
40. The most important use of the Bloomfield Track is for tourism.
41. I would be worse off if more of the Daintree rainforest is protected.
42. Let's fix the problems in the Daintree just for now. The future will take care of itself.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. There is no reason to believe that the Daintree Rainforest is under threat.
2. In deciding on what to do with the Bloomfield Track I don't know whether it's more important to meet the needs of the community or the environment.
3. Using cars on the Bloomfield Track is bad for the rainforest.
4. The Bloomfield Track may not have been the best idea, but I guess there is probably little point in closing it now that it has been built.
5. Economic development associated with the Bloomfield Track will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
6. I would be worse off if more of the Daintree rainforest is protected.
7. I think that both short and long term perspectives are needed in deciding what should be done with the Bloomfield Track, but I don't know which one is more important.
8. I don't know if improving the Bloomfield Track would lead to a rapid acceleration of development in the area to the detriment of the environment.
9. Everyone in Queensland is better off for having a road like the Bloomfield Track.
10. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track is permanently damaging the coral reefs that fringe the beaches below
11. The future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by everyone and not just by those who live in the Bloomfield area.
12. Whilst impacts on locals in the Bloomfield area are a concern, it is the broader community that should carry more weight when deciding what to do with the Bloomfield Track.
13. I'm concerned that I will be made worse off by any decision about the Bloomfield Track.
14. I'm not sure if the future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by locals, outsiders or both.
15. Let's fix the problems in the Daintree just for now. The future will take care of itself.
16. The Bloomfield Track is important because it allows quick access to remote areas of the North.
17. Any decision about the Bloomfield Track will greatly affect people like me.
18. I don't really know who benefits most from the protection of Rainforest in the Daintree.
19. The Wujal Wujal Community is better off now that the Bloomfield Track has been built.
20. I don't know how, but I think that there must be some way in which everybody benefits from protecting the rainforest near the Bloomfield Track.
21. The protection of plants and animals in the Daintree is OK so long as it doesn't affect me.
22. The fate of the Bloomfield Track is of no concern to me.
23. Native animals in the Daintree need protection because they have a right to life which cannot be traded against economic considerations.
24. Conservation in the Daintree area is worthwhile at whatever cost.
25. The most important use of the Bloomfield Track is for tourism.
26. The Bloomfield Track issue is important for Queensland.
27. If the Bloomfield Track is sealed (bitumenized) there will not be a rapid increase in environmentally damaging development in the Daintree area in the future It may even benefit the environment there.
28. The coral reefs along the foreshore below the Bloomfield Track are not badly affected by the road.
29. The road is just the 'thin edge of the wedge'. This may not happen for a long time, but it will happen.
30. Laying bitumen on the Bloomfield Track would be beneficial for the environment
31. I don't know what the people of Bloomfield think about the Bloomfield Track.
32. If future generations could have their say about the Bloomfield track, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
33. No development should be permitted in World Heritage areas such as the Daintree.
34. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track does not cause siltation or damage to the fringing inshore reefs between Cape Tribulation and Cooktown
35. A long term perspective on the Bloomfield Track is essential.
36. When it comes to the Bloomfield track, people living in Cairns are in no position to judge what the interests of the local residents of Bloomfield are.

38. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Daintree region because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
39. I have no idea what the people in the Bloomfield area think about the Bloomfield Track.
40. I don't like how development is creeping further and further North into the Daintree and beyond because of its effect on the environment.
41. When it comes to the Bloomfield Track, it's not important to worry about what the future will hold
42. If we don't take steps to protect the Daintree Rainforest future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the area as we do now.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
2. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
3. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
4. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
5. We live in a great democracy.
6. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
7. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
8. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
9. I'm always cynical about government processes.
10. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
11. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
12. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
13. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
14. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
15. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
16. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
17. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
18. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
19. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
20. We are a democratic country.
21. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
22. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
23. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
24. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
25. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
26. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
27. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
28. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
29. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
30. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
31. People get the government they deserve
32. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
33. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
34. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
35. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
36. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
37. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
38. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
39. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
40. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
41. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
42. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
43. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
44. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
45. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
46. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
47. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.

1. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
2. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
3. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
4. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
5. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
6. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
7. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
8. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
9. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
10. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
11. We live in a great democracy.
12. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
13. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
14. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
15. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
16. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
17. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
18. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
19. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
20. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
21. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
22. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
23. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
24. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
25. I'm always cynical about government processes.
26. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
27. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
28. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
29. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
30. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
31. We are a democratic country.
32. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
33. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
34. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
35. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
36. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
37. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
38. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
39. People get the government they deserve
40. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
41. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
42. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
43. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
44. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
45. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
46. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
47. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
48. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.","1. 4

1. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
2. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
3. People get the government they deserve
4. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
5. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
6. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
7. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
8. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
9. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
10. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
11. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
12. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
13. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
14. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
15. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
16. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
17. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
18. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
19. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
20. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
21. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
22. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
23. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
24. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
25. I'm always cynical about government processes.
26. We are a democratic country.
27. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
28. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
29. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
30. We live in a great democracy.
31. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
32. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
33. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
34. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
35. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
36. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
37. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
38. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
39. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
40. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
41. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
42. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
43. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
44. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
45. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
46. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
47. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
48. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. ","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
2. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
3. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
4. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
5. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
6. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
7. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
8. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
9. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
10. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
11. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
12. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
13. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
14. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
15. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
16. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
17. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
18. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
19. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
20. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
21. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
22. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
23. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
24. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
25. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
26. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
27. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
28. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
29. People get the government they deserve
30. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
31. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
32. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
33. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
34. I'm always cynical about government processes.
35. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
36. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
37. We are a democratic country.
38. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
39. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
40. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
41. We live in a great democracy.
42. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
43. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
44. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
45. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
46. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
47. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
48. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.","1. 6

10. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.

13. We can adapt to the coming changes.
14. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
15. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
16. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
17. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
18. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.

20. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.

1. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
2. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
3. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
4. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
5. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
6. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
7. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
8. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
9. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
10. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
11. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
12. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
13. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
14. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
15. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
16. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
17. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
18. I care about the planet.
19. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
20. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
21. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
22. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
23. We can adapt to the coming changes.
24. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
25. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
26. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
27. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.

## [Considerations]:
1. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
2. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
3. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
4. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
5. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
6. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
7. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
8. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
9. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
10. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
11. I care about the planet.
12. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
13. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
14. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
15. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
16. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
17. We can adapt to the coming changes.
18. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
19. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
20. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
21. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
22. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
23. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
24. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
25. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
26. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
27. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
28. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
29. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
30. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
31. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
32. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
33. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
2. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
3. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
4. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
5. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
6. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
7. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
8. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
9. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
10. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
11. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
12. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
13. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
14. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
15. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
16. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
17. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
18. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
19. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
20. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
21. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
22. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
23. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
24. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
25. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
26. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
27. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
28. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
29. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
30. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
31. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
32. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
33. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
34. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
35. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
36. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
37. Forest health means jobs.
38. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
39. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
40. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
41. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
42. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
43. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
44. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
45. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
2. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
3. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
4. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
5. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
6. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
7. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
8. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
9. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
10. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
11. Forest health means jobs.
12. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
13. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
14. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
15. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
16. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
17. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
18. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
19. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
20. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
21. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
22. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
23. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
24. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
25. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
26. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
27. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
28. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
29. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
30. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
31. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
32. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
33. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
34. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
35. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
36. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
37. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
38. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
39. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
40. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
41. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
42. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
43. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
44. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
45. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. ","1. 10

1. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
2. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
3. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
4. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
5. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
6. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
7. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
8. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
9. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
10. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
11. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
12. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
13. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
14. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
15. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
16. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
17. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
18. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
19. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
20. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
21. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
22. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
23. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
24. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
25. Forest health means jobs.
26. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
27. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
28. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
29. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
30. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
31. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
32. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
33. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
34. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
35. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
36. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
37. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
38. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
39. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
40. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
41. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
42. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
43. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
44. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
45. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.","1. 6

17. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
18. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
19. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
20. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
21. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
22. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
23. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
24. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
25. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
26. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.

28. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
29. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
30. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
31. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.

## [Considerations]:
1. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
2. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
3. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
4. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
5. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
6. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
7. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
8. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
9. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
10. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
11. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
12. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
13. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
14. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
15. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
16. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
17. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
18. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
19. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
20. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
21. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
22. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
23. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
24. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
25. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
26. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
27. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
28. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
29. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
30. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
31. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
32. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
33. Forest health means jobs.
34. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
35. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
36. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
37. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
38. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
39. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
40. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
41. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
42. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
43. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
44. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
45. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
2. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
3. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
4. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
5. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
6. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
7. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
8. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
9. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
10. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
11. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
12. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
13. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
14. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
15. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
16. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
17. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
18. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
19. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
20. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
21. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
22. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
23. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
24. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
25. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
26. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
27. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
28. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
29. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
30. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
31. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. ","1. 7

1. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
2. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
3. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
4. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
5. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
6. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
7. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
8. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
9. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
10. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
11. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
12. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
13. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
14. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
15. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
16. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
17. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
18. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
19. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
20. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
21. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
22. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change.

7. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
8. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.

17. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
18. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
19. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
20. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
21. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
22. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
23. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
24. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
25. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
26. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
27. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
28. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.

5. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
6. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
7. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
8. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
9. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
10. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
11. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
12. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
13. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
14. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
15. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
16. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
17. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
18. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
19. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
20. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
21. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
22. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
23. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.

## [Considerations]:
1. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
2. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
3. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
4. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
5. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
6. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
7. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
8. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
9. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
10. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
11. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
12. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
13. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
14. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
15. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
16. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
17. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
18. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
19. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
20. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
21. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
22. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
23. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
24. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
25. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
26. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
27. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
28. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
29. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.

## [Considerations]:
1. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
2. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
3. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
4. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
5. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
6. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
7. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
8. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
9. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
10. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
11. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
12. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
13. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
14. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
15. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
16. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
17. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
18. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
19. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
20. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
21. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
22. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
23. Food waste is a major environmental issue
24. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
25. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
26. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
27. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
28. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
29. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
30. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices","1. 6

1. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
2. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
3. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
4. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
5. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
6. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
7. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
8. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
9. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
10. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
11. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
12. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
13. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
14. Food waste is a major environmental issue
15. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
16. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
17. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
18. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
19. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
20. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
21. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
22. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
23. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
24. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
25. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
26. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste

1. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
2. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
3. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
4. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
5. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
6. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
7. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
8. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
9. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
10. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
11. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
12. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
13. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
14. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
15. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
16. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
17. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
18. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
19. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
20. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
21. Food waste is a major environmental issue
22. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
23. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
24. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
25. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
26. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
27. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
28. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
29. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
30. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)","1. 5

1. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
2. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
3. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
4. Food waste is a major environmental issue
5. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
6. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
7. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
8. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
9. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
10. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
11. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
12. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
13. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
14. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
15. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
16. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
17. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
18. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
19. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
20. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
21. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
22. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
23. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
24. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
25. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
26. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products

28. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
29. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them

2. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
3. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
4. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
5. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
6. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
7. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
8. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
9. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
10. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
11. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
12. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
13. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
14. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
15. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
16. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
17. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
18. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
19. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
20. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
21. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
22. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
23. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
24. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
25. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
26. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
27. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
28. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
29. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
30. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
31. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
32. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.","1. 2

4. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
5. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
6. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
7. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
8. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
9. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
10. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
11. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.

13. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
14. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
15. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
16. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
17. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
18. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
19. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.

4. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
5. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
6. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
7. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
8. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
9. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
10. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
11. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
12. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
13. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
14. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
15. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
16. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
17. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
18. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
19. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
20. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
21. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
22. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
23. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
24. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
25. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
26. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
27. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
28. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
29. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
30. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
31. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.

6. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
7. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
8. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
9. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
10. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
11. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.

16. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
17. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
18. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
19. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
20. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
21. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
22. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.

## [Considerations]:
1. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
2. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
3. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
4. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
5. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
6. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
7. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
8. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
9. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
10. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
11. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
12. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
13. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
14. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
15. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
16. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
17. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
18. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
19. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
20. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
21. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
22. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
23. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
24. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
25. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
26. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
27. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
28. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
29. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
30. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
31. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
32. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
33. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
34. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
35. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
36. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
37. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
38. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
39. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
40. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
41. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
42. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
43. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
2. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
3. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
4. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
5. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
6. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
7. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
8. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
9. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
10. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
11. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
12. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
13. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
14. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
15. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
16. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
17. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
18. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
19. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
20. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
21. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
22. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
23. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
24. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
25. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
26. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
27. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
28. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
29. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
30. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
31. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
32. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
33. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
34. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
35. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
36. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
37. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
38. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
39. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
40. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
41. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
42. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.

## [Considerations]:
1. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
2. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
3. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
4. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
5. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
6. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
7. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
8. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
9. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
10. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
11. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
12. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
13. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
14. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
15. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
16. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
17. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
18. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
19. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
20. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
21. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
22. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
23. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
24. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
25. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
26. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
27. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
28. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
29. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
30. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
31. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
32. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
33. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
34. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
35. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
36. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
37. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
38. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
39. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
40. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
41. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
42. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
43. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations","1. 2

39. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
40. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
41. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.

27. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
28. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
29. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable

## [Considerations]:
1. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
2. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
3. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
4. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
5. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
6. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
7. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
8. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
9. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
10. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
11. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
12. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
13. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
14. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
15. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
16. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
17. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
18. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
19. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
20. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
21. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
22. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
23. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
24. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
25. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
26.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
27. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
28. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
29. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
30. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
31. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
32. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
33. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
34. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
35. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
36. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
37. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
38. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
39. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
40. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
41. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
42. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
43. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
44. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.

## [Considerations]:
1. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
2. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
3. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
4. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
5. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
6. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
7. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
8. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
9. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
10. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
11. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
12. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
13. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
14. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
15. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
16. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
17. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
18.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
19. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
20. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
21. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
22. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
23. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
24. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
25. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
26. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
27. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
28. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
29. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
30. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
31. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
32. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
33. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
34. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
35. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
36. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
37. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
38. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
39. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
40. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
41. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
42. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
43. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
44. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
45. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.","1. 2

4. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
5. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
6. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
7. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
8. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
9. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
10. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
11. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
12. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
13. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
14. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
15. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
16. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
17. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
18. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
19.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
20. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
21. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
22. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
23. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
24. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
25. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
26. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
27. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
28. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
29. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
30. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
31. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
32. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
33. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
34. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
35. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
36. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
37. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
38. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
39. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
40. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
41. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
42. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
43. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
44. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
45. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
2. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
3. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
4. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
5. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
6. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
7. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
8. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
9. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
10. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
11. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
12. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
13. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
14. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
15. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
16. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
17. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
18. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
19. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
20. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
21. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
22. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
23. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
24. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
25. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
26. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
27. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
28. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
29. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
30. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
31. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
32. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
33. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
34. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
35. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
36. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
37. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
38. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
39. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
40.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
41. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
42. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
43. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
44. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).

## [Considerations]:
1. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
2. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
3. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
4. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
5. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
6. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
7. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
8. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
9. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
10. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
11. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
12. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
13. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
14. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
15. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
16. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
17. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
18. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
19. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
20. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
21. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
22. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
23. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
24. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
25. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
26. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
27. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
28. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
29. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
30. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
31. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
32. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
33. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
34. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
35.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
36. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
37. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
38. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
39. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
40. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
41. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
42. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
43. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
44. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
45. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
2. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
3. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
4. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
5. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
6. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
7. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
8. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
9. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
10. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
11. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
12. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
13. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
14. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
15. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
16. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
17. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
18. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
19. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
20. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
21. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
22. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
23. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
24. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
25. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
26. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
27. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
28. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
29. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
30. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
31. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
32. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
33. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
34. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
35. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. ","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
2. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
3. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
4. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
5. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
6. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
7. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
8. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
9. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
10. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
11. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
12. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
13. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
14. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
15. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
16. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
17. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
18. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
19. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
20. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
21. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
22. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
23. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
24. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
25. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
26. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
27. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
28. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
29. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
30. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
31. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
32. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
33. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
34. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
35. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.","1. 4

## [Considerations]:
1. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
2. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
3. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
4. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
5. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
6. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
7. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
8. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
9. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
10. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
11. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
12. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
13. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
14. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
15. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
16. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
17. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
18. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
19. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
20. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
21. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
22. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
23. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
24. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
25. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
26. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
27. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
28. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
29. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
30. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
31. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
32. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
33. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
34. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.

## [Considerations]:
1. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
2. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
3. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
4. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
5. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
6. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
7. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
8. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
9. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
10. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
11. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
12. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
13. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
14. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
15. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
16. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
17. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
18. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
19. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
20. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
21. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
22. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
23. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
24. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
25. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
26. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
27. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
28. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
29. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
30. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
31. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
32. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
33. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.

## [Considerations]:
1. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
2. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
3. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
4. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
5. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
6. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
7. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
8. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
9. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
10. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
11. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
12. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
13. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
14. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
15. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
16. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
17. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
18. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
19. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
20. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
21. Genome editing is really cool science.
22. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
23. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
24. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
25. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
26. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
27. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
28. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
29. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.

1. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
2. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
3. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
4. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
5. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
6. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
7. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
8. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
9. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
10. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
11. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
12. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
13. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
14. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
15. Genome editing is really cool science.
16. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
17. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
18. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
19. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
20. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
21. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
22. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
23. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
24. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
25. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
26. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
27. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
28. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
29. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
30. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
31. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
32. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
33. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
34. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
35. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
36. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
37. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
38. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
39. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
40. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
41. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
42. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
43. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
44. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.

2. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
3. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
4. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
5. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
6. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
7. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
8. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
9. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
10. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
11. Genome editing is really cool science.
12. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
13. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
14. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
15. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
16. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
17. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
18. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
19. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
20. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
21. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
22. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
23. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
24. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
25. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
26. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
27. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
28. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
29. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
30. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
31. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
32. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
33. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
34. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
35. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
36. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
37. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
38. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
39. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
40. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
41. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
42. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
43. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
44. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.

## [Considerations]:
1. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
2. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
3. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
4. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
5. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
6. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
7. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
8. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
9. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
10. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
11. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
12. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
13. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
14. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
15. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
16. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
17. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
18. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
19. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
20. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
21. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
22. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
23. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
24. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.","1. 4

## [Considerations]:
1. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
2. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
3. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
4. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
5. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
6. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
7. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
8. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
9. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
10. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
11. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
12. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
13. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
14. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
15. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
16. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
17. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
18. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
19. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
20. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
21. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
22. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
23. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
24. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.","1. 4

## [Considerations]:
1. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
2. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
3. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
4. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
5. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
6. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
7. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
8. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
9. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
10. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
11. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
12. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
13. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
14. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
15. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
16. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
17. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
18. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
19. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
20. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
21. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
22. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
23. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
24. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
25. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
26. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
27. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
28. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
29. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
30. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
31. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
32. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
33. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
34. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
35. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
36. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
37. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
38. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
39. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
40. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
41. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
42. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
43. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
44. Genetic research will improve our lives.
45. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
46. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
47. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
48. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
49. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.","1. 11

## [Considerations]:
1. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
2. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
3. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
4. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
5. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
6. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
7. Genetic research will improve our lives.
8. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
9. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
10. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
11. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
12. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
13. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
14. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
15. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
16. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
17. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
18. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
19. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
20. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
21. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
22. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
23. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
24. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
25. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
26. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
27. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
28. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
29. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
30. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
31. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
32. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
33. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
34. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
35. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
36. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
37. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
38. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
39. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
40. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
41. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
42. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
43. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
44. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
45. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
46. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
47. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
48. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
49. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.","1. 7

28. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
29. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
30. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
31. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
32. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
33. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
34. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
35. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.

44. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
45. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
46. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
47. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
48. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
49. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results","1. 10

3. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
4. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
5. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
6. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
7. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
8. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
9. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
10. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
11. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
12. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
13. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
14. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
15. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
16. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
17. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
18. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
19. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.

26. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
27. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
28. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
29. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
30. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
31. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.

## [Considerations]:
1. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
2. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
3. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
4. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
5. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
6. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
7. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
8. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
9. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
10. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
11. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
12. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
13. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
14. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
15. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
16. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
17. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
18. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
19. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
20. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
21. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
22. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
23. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.

3. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
4. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
5. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.

7. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
8. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
9. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
10. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.

13. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
14. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
15. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
16. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
17. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
18. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
19. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
20. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
21. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
22. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.

## [Considerations]:
1. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
2. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
3. We are a democratic country.
4. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
5. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
6. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
7. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
8. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
9. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
10. We live in a great democracy.
11. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
12. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
13. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
14. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
15. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
16. I'm always cynical about government processes.
17. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
18. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
19. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
20. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
21. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
22. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
23. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
24. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
25. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
26. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
27. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
28. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
29. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
30. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
31. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
32. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
33. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
34. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
35. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
36. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
37. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
38. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
39. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
40. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
41. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
42. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
43. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
44. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
45. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
46. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
47. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.

## [Considerations]:
1. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
2. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
3. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
4. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
5. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
6. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
7. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
8. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
9. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
10. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
11. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
12. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
13. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
14. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
15. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
16. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
17. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
18. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
19. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
20. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
21. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
22. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
23. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
24. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
25. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
26. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
27. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
28. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
29. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
30. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
31. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
32. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
33. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
34. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
35. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. ","1. 2
