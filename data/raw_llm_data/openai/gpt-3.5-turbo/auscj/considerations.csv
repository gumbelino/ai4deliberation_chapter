I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.,C7. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.,C8. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.,C9. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.,"C10. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.","C11. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.",C12. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.,C13. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.,C14.
