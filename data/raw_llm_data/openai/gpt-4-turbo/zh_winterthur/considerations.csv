cuid,created_at,provider,model,temperature,input_tokens,output_tokens,"C1. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?",C2. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.,C3. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming,C4. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature,C5. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability,C6. Food waste is a major environmental issue,C7. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world),C8. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply,C9. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy,C10. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic,C11. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment,C12. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture,"C13. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)",C14. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture,C15. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries,"C16. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled","C17. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away","C18. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products",C19. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics,"C20. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them","C21. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices",C22. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.,C23. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste,"C24. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.","C25. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality","C26. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste",C27. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products,"C28. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it",C29. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests),C30. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
