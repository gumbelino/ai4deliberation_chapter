## [Considerations]:
1. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
2. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
3. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
4. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
5. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
6. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
7. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
8. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
9. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
10. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
11. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
12. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
13. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
14. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
15. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
16. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
17. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
18. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
19. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
20. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
21. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
22. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
23. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
24. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
25. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
26. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
27. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
28. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
29. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
30. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
31. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
32. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
33. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
34. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
35. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
36. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
37. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
38. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
39. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
40. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
41. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
42. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
43. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
2. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
3. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
4. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
5. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
6. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
7. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
8. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
9. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
10. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
11. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
12. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
13. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.

32. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
33. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
34. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
35. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.

42. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
43. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
44. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.

47. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
48. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.","1. 9

34. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
35. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
36. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
37. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
38. We live in a great democracy.
39. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
40. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
41. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
42. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
43. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
44. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.

## [Considerations]:
1. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
2. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
3. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
4. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
5. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
6. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
7. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
8. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
9. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
10. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
11. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
12. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
13. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
14. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
15. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
16. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
17. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
18. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
19. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
20. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
21. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
22. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
23. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
24. We are a democratic country.
25. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
26. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
27. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
28. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
29. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
30. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
31. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
32. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
33. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
34. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
35. I'm always cynical about government processes.
36. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
37. People get the government they deserve
38. We live in a great democracy.
39. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
40. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
41. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
42. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
43. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
44. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
45. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
46. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
47. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
48. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.","1. 4

11. I care about the planet.
12. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
13. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
14. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
15. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
16. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
17. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
18. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
19. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
20. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
21. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.

2. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
3. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
4. I care about the planet.
5. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
6. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
7. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
8. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
9. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
10. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
11. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
12. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
13. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
14. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
15. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
16. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
17. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
18. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
19. We can adapt to the coming changes.
20. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
21. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
22. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
23. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
24. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
25. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
26. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
27. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.

## [Considerations]:
1. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
2. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
3. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
4. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
5. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
6. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
7. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
8. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
9. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
10. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
11. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
12. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
13. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
14. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
15. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
16. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
17. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
18. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
19. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
20. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
21. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
22. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
23. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
24. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
25. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
26. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
27. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
28. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
29. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
30. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
31. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
32. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
33. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
34. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
35. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
36. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
37. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
38. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
39. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
40. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
41. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
42. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
43. Forest health means jobs.
44. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
45. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
2. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
3. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
4. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
5. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
6. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
7. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
8. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
9. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
10. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
11. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
12. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
13. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
14. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
15. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
16. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
17. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
18. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
19. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
20. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
21. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
22. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
23. Forest health means jobs.
24. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
25. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
26. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
27. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
28. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
29. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
30. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
31. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
32. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
33. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
34. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
35. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
36. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
37. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
38. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
39. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
40. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
41. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
42. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
43. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
44. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
45. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. ","1. 9

30. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
31. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
32. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
33. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
34. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
35. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
36. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
37. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
38. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
39. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
40. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
41. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
42. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
43. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
44. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
45. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.","1. 7

1. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
2. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
3. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
4. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
5. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
6. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
7. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
8. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
9. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
10. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
11. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
12. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
13. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
14. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
15. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
16. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
17. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
18. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
19. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
20. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
21. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
22. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
23. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
24. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
25. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
26. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
2. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
3. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
4. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
5. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
6. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
7. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
8. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
9. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
10. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
11. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
12. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
13. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
14. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
15. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
16. Food waste is a major environmental issue
17. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
18. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
19. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
20. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
21. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
22. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
23. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
24. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
25. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
26. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
27. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
28. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
29. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
30. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
2. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
3. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
4. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
5. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
6. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
7. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
8. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
9. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
10. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
11. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
12. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
13. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
14. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
15. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
16. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
17. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
18. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
19. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
20. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
21. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
22. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
23. Food waste is a major environmental issue
24. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
25. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
26. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
27. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
28. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy

1. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
2. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
3. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
4. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
5. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
6. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
7. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
8. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
9. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
10. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
2. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
3. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
4. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
5. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
6. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
7. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
8. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
9. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
10. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
11. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
12. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
13. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
14. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
15. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
16. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
17. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
18. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
19. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
20. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
21. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
22. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
23. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
24. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
25. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
26. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
27. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
28. It is certain that climate change exists.
29. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
30. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
31. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
32. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
33. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.","1. 7

2. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
3. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
4. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
5. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
6. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
7. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
8. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
9. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.

11. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
12. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
13. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
14. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
15. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
16. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
17. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
18. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.

1. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
2. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
3. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
4. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
5. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
6. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
7. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
8. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
9. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
10. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
11. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
12. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
13. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
14. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
15. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
16. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
17. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
18. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
19. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
20. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
21. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
22. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
23. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
24. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
25. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
26. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
27. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
28. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
29. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
30. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
31. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
32. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
33. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
34. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
35. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
36. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
37. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
38. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
39. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
40. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
41. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?

## [Considerations]:
1. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
2. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
3. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
4. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
5. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
6. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
7. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
8. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
9. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
10. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
11. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
12. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
13. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
14. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
15. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
16. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
17. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
18. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
19. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
20. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
21. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
22. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
23. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
24. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
25. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
26. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
27. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
28. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
29. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
30. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
31. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
32. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
33. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
34. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
35. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
36. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
37. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
38. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
39. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
40. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
41. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
42. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
2. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
3. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
4. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
5. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
6. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
7. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
8. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
9. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
10. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
11. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
12. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
13. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
14. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
15. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
16. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
17. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
18. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
19. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
20. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
21. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
22. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
23. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
24. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
25. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
26. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
27. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
28. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
29. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
30. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
31. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
32. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
33. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
34.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
35. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
36. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
37. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
38. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
39. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
40. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
41. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
42. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
43. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
44. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
45. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.","1. 9

21. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
22. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
23. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
24. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
25. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
26. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
27. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
28. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
29. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
30. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
31. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
32. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
33. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
34. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
35. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
36. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
37. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
38. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
39. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
40. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
41. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
42. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
43. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
44. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
45. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.","1. 10

## [Considerations]:
1. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
2. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
3. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
4. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
5. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
6. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
7. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
8. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
9. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
10. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
11. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
12. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
13. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
14. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
15. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
16. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
17. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
18. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
19. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
20. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
21. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
22. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
23. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
24. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
25. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
26. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
27. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
28. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
29. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
30. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
31. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
32. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
33. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
34. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
35. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
36. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
37.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
38. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
39. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
40. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
41. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
42. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
43. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
44. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.

9. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
10. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
11. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
12. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion

14. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
15. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
16. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
17. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
18. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
19. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
20. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna

22. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
23. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
24. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
25. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
26. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
27. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.

1. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
2. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
3. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power

9. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
10. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
11. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
12. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
13. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion

23. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.

## [Considerations]:
1. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
2. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
3. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
4. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
5. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
6. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
7. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
8. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
9. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
10. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
11. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
12. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
13. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
14. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
15. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
16. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
17. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
18. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
19. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
20. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
21. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
22. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
23. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
24. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
25. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
26. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
27. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
28. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
29. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
30. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
31. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
32. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
33. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
34. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
35. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
2. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
3. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
4. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
5. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
6. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
7. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
8. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
9. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
10. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
11. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
12. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
13. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
14. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
15. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
16. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
17. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
18. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
19. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
20. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
21. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
22. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
23. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
24. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
25. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
26. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
27. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
28. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
29. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
30. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
31. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
32. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
33. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment.

1. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
2. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
3. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
4. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
5. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
6. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
7. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
8. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
9. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
10. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
11. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
12. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
13. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
14. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
15. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
16. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
17. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
18. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
19. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
20. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
21. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
22. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
23. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
24. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
25. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
26. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
27. Genome editing is really cool science.
28. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
29. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
30. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
31. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
32. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
33. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
34. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
35. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
36. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
37. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
38. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
39. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.

1. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
2. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
3. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
4. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
5. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
6. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
7. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
8. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
9. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
10. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
11. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
12. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
13. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
14. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
15. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
16. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
17. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
18. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
19. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
20. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
21. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
22. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.

## [Considerations]:
1. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
2. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
3. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
4. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
5. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
6. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
7. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
8. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
9. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
10. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
11. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
12. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
13. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
14. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
15. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
16. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
17. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
18. We are a democratic country.
19. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
20. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
21. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
22. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
23. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
24. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
25. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
26. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
27. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
28. We live in a great democracy.
29. I'm always cynical about government processes.
30. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
31. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
32. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
33. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
34. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
35. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
36. People get the government they deserve
37. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
38. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
39. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
40. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
41. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
42. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
43. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
44. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
45. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
46. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
47. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
48. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
2. People get the government they deserve
3. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
4. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
5. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
6. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
7. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
8. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
9. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
10. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
11. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
12. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
13. We are a democratic country.
14. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
15. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
16. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
17. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
18. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
19. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
20. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
21. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
22. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
23. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
24. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
25. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
26. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
27. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
28. I'm always cynical about government processes.
29. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
30. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
31. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
32. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
33. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
34. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
35. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
36. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
37. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
38. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
39. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
40. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
41. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
42. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
43. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
44. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
45. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
46. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
47. We live in a great democracy.
48. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
2. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
3. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
4. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
5. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
6. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
7. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
8. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
9. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
10. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
11. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
12. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
13. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
14. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
15. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
16. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
17. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
18. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
19. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
20. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
21. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
22. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
23. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
24. We are a democratic country.
25. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
26. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
27. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
28. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
29. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
30. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
31. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
32. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
33. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
34. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
35. I'm always cynical about government processes.
36. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
37. People get the government they deserve
38. We live in a great democracy.
39. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
40. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
41. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
42. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
43. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
44. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
45. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
46. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
47. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
48. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.","1. 3

13. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
14. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
15. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
16. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
17. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
18. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
19. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
20. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
21. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.

1. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
2. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
3. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
4. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
5. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
6. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
7. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
8. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
9. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
10. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
11. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
12. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
13. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
14. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
15. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
16. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
17. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
18. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
19. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
20. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
21. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
22. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
23. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
24. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
25. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
26. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
27. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?

## [Considerations]:
1. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
2. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
3. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
4. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
5. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
6. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
7. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
8. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
9. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
10. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
11. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
12. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
13. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
14. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
15. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
16. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
17. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
18. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
19. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
20. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
21. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
22. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
23. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
24. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
25. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
26. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
27. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
28. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
29. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
30. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
31. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
32. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
33. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
34. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
35. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
36. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
37. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
38. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
39. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
40. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
41. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
42. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
43. Forest health means jobs.
44. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
45. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.","1. 4

## [Considerations]:
1. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
2. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
3. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
4. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
5. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
6. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
7. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
8. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
9. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
10. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
11. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
12. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
13. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
14. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
15. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
16. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
17. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
18. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
19. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
20. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
21. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
22. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
23. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
24. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
25. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
26. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
27. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
28. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
29. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
30. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
31. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
32. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
33. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
34. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
35. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
36. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
37. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
38. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
39. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
40. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
41. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
42. Forest health means jobs.
43. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
44. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.

## [Considerations]:
1. Genetic information is different from health information. 
2. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies.
3. Participants should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at anytime. 
4. Everyone should donate samples to a biobank for the benefit of everyone. 
5. There is no risk to the participants who donate to biobanks.
6. Aboriginal communities require special consideration concerning healthcare and research.
7. Policy makers should consider the possibility that Canada should not pursue biobanking.
8. Genetic research will improve our lives.
9. The priority for healthcare should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
10. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
11. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for bothers me. 
12. Educating people about health issues (e.g. diet and lifestyle changes) promises greater health effects than investing in biobanks.
13. It is always permissible to do research on my personally identifiable sample without my prior permission.  
14. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health.
15. The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  
16. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
17. I do not care if my donated sample is connected to my name and medical information.
18. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government. 
19. Participants should be contacted every time researchers want to use their samples for research.
20. Genetic studies of race on enthocultural communities will lead to the discrimination of those same enthocultural communities. 
21. Scientists should have access to all unidentified, personal samples for research.
22. To me, religious communities need to be consulted about genetic and biobank research. 
23. Participants should be active in the set up and oversight of  biobanks. 
24. All participants should be paid for donating their samples to a biobank. 
25. Profits from biobanking should be returned to the donating community. 
26. I trust researchers to control access to my personal samples.
27. Genetic studies of disability will lead to the discrimination of people living with the same conditions.
28. I should have property rights to my tissues before or after they leave my body.
29. Biobanks will only lead to expensive treatments and high profits. 
30. If someone is a carrier of a genetic disease, they have a responsibility to participate in genetic research.
31. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.  
32. Researchers should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.  
33. Participants who donate their samples for research should be given special access to the treatments and therapies that result from that research. 
34. My personal sample should never be anonymized since I should be informed of important research results.  
35. Biobanks need independent review boards to determine who should have access to samples. 
36. Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.
37. There is no point in consulting the public about ethical issues in science and technology.
38. Sampling some people in an ethnocultural community is acceptable only if the whole ethnocultural community has agreed to participate.","1. 4

1. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
2. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
3. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
4. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
5. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
6. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
7. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
8. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
9. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
10. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
11. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
12. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
13. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
14. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
15. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
16. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
17. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
18. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
19. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?

## [Considerations]:
1. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
2. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
3. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
4. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
5. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
6. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
7. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
8. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
9. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
10. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
11. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
12. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
13. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
14. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
15. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
16. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
17. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
18. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
19. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
20. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
21. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
22. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
23. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
24. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
25. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
26. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
27. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
28. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.

## [Considerations]:
1. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
2. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
3. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
4. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
5. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
6. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
7. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
8. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
9. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
10. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
11. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
12. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
13. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
14. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
15. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
16. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
17. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
18. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
19. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
20. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
21. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
22. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
23. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
24. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
25. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
26. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
27. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
28. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
29. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.

6. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
7. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
8. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
9. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
10. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
11. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
12. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
13. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
14. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
15. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
16. Food waste is a major environmental issue
17. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
18. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
19. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
20. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
21. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
22. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
23. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
24. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
25. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
26. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
27. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
28. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
29. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them

## [Considerations]:
1. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
2. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
3. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
4. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
5. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
6. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
7. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
8. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
9. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
10. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
11. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
12. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
13. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
14. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
15. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
16. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
17. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
18. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
19. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
20. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
21. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
22. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
23. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
24. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
25. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
26. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
27. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
28. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
29. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
30. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
31. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
32. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.","1. 1

1. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
2. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
3. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
4. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
5. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
6. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
7. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
8. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
9. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
10. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
11. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
12. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
13. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
14. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
15. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
16. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
17. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
18. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
19. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
20. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
21. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
22. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
23. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
24. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
25. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
26. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.

## [Considerations]:
1. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
2. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
3. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
4. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
5. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
6. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
7. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
8. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
9. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
10. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
11. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
12. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
13. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
14. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
15. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
16. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
17. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
18. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
19. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
20. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
21. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
22. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
23. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
24. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
25. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
26. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
27. It is certain that climate change exists.
28. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
29. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
30. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
31. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
32. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.

19. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
20. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
21. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
22. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
23. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
24. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
25. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
26. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).

12. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
13. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
14. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
15. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
16. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
17. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.

## [Considerations]:
1. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
2. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
3. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
4. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
5. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
6. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
7. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
8. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
9. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
10. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
11. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
12. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
13. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
14. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
15. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
16. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
17. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
18. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
19. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
20. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
21. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
22. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
23. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
24. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
25. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
26. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
27. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
28. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
29. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
30. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
31. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
32. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
33. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
34. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
35. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
36. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
37. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
38. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
39. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
40. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
41. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
42. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.

## [Considerations]:
1. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
2. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
3. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
4. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
5. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
6. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
7. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
8. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
9. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
10. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
11. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
12. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
13. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
14. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
15. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
16. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
17. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
18. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
19. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
20. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
21. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
22. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
23. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
24. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
25. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
26. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
27. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
28. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
29. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
30. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
31. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
32. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
33. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
34. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
35. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
36. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
37. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
38. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
39. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
40. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
41. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
42. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
43. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
2. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
3. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
4. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
5. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
6. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
7. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
8. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
9. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
10. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
11. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
12. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
13. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
14. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
15. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
16. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
17. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
18. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
19. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
20. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
21. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
22. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
23. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
24. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
25. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
26. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
27. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
28. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
29. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
30. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
31. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.

33. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
34.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
35. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
36. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
37. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
38. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
39. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.

41. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
42. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
43. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.

1. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
2. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
3. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
4. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
5. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
6. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
7. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
8. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
9. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
10. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
11. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
12. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
13. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
14. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
15. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
16. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
17. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
18. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
19. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
20. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
21. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
22. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
23. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
24. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
25. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
26. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
27. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
28. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
29. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
30. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
31. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
32. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
33. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
34. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
35. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
36. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
37. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
38. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
39. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
40.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
41. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
42. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
43. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
44. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.

## [Considerations]:
1. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
2. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
3. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
4. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
5. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
6. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
7. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
8. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
9. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
10. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
11. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
12. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
13. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
14. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
15. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
16. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
17. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
18. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
19. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
20. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
21. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
22. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
23. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
24. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
25. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
26. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
27. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
28. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
29. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
30. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
31. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
32. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
33. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
34. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
35. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
36. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
37.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
38. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
39. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
40. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
41. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
42. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
43. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
44. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
45. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.","1. 10

## [Considerations]:
1. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
2. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
3. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
4. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
5. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
6. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
7. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
8. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
9. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
10. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
11. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
12. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
13. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
14. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
15. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
16. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
17. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
18. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
19. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
20. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
21. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
22. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
23. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
24. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
25. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
26. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
27. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
28. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
29. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
30. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
31. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
32. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
33. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
34. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
35. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.","1. 7

3. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
4. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
5. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
6. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
7. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
8. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
9. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
10. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
11. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
12. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.

26. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
27. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
28. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
29. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
30. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
31. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
32. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
33. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment.

2. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
3. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
4. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
5. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
6. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
7. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
8. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
9. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
10. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
11. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
12. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
13. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
14. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
15. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
16. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
17. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
18. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
19. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
20. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
21. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
22. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
23. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
24. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
25. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
26. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
27. Genome editing is really cool science.
28. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
29. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
30. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
31. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
32. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
33. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
34. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
35. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
36. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
37. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
38. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
39. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
40. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
41. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
42. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
43. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
44. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.

## [Considerations]:
1. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
2. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
3. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
4. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
5. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
6. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
7. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
8. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
9. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
10. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
11. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
12. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
13. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
14. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
15. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
16. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
17. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
18. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
19. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
20. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
21. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
22. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
23. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
24. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.","1. 6

1. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
2. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
3. Genetic research will improve our lives.
4. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
5. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
6. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
7. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
8. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
9. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
10. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
11. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
12. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
13. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
14. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
15. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
16. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
17. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
18. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
19. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
20. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
21. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
22. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
23. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
24. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
25. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
26. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
27. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
28. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
29. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
30. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
31. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
32. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
33. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
34. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
35. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
36. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
37. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
38. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
39. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.

42. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
43. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
44. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
45. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
46. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
47. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
48. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
