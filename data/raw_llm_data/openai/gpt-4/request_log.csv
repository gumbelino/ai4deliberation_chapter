12. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track is permanently damaging the coral reefs that fringe the beaches below

14. I'm concerned that I will be made worse off by any decision about the Bloomfield Track.
15. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Daintree region because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
16. Whilst impacts on locals in the Bloomfield area are a concern, it is the broader community that should carry more weight when deciding what to do with the Bloomfield Track.

24. The fate of the Bloomfield Track is of no concern to me.
25. I think that both short and long term perspectives are needed in deciding what should be done with the Bloomfield Track, but I don't know which one is more important.

27. Everyone in Queensland is better off for having a road like the Bloomfield Track.
28. The future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by everyone and not just by those who live in the Bloomfield area.

## [Considerations]:
1. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
2. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
3. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
4. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
5. We live in a great democracy.
6. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
7. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
8. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
9. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
10. We are a democratic country.
11. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
12. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
13. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
14. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
15. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
16. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
17. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
18. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
19. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
20. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
21. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
22. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
23. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
24. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
25. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
26. I'm always cynical about government processes.
27. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
28. People get the government they deserve
29. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
30. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
31. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
32. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
33. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
34. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
35. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
36. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
37. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
38. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
39. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
40. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
41. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
42. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
43. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
44. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
45. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
46. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
47. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
48. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.","1. 4

1. I care about the planet.
2. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
3. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
4. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
5. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
6. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
7. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
8. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
9. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
10. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
11. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
12. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
13. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.

15. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
16. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
17. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
18. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
19. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
20. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
21. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
22. We can adapt to the coming changes.
23. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
24. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
25. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
26. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
27. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
28. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
29. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
30. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
31. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
32. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
2. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
3. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
4. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
5. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
6. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
7. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
8. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
9. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
10. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
11. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
12. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
13. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
14. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
15. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
16. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
17. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
18. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
19. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
20. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
21. Forest health means jobs.
22. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
23. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
24. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
25. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
26. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
27. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
28. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
29. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
30. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
31. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
32. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
33. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
34. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
35. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
36. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
37. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
38. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
39. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
40. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
41. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
42. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
43. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
44. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
45. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
2. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
3. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
4. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
5. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
6. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
7. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
8. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
9. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
10. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
11. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
12. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
13. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
14. Food waste is a major environmental issue
15. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
16. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
17. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
18. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
19. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
20. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
21. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
22. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
23. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
24. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
25. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
26. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
27. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
28. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
29. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
30. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices","1. 4

11. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
12. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
13. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
14. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
15. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.

20. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
21. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
22. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
23. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
24. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
25. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
26. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
27. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
28. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
29. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
30. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.

2. There are no specific economic benefits for the Fremantle from the bridge.
3. This magnificent timber bridge is a rare and beautiful sight in today's world, it should be preserved. 
4. Indigenous people would want to minimize impact on the Swan River, a registered site, that is of importance and significance to them.
5. The old bridge provides a scenic entrance to Fremantle that attracts tourists.
6. The problem is not the vulnerable structure of the bridge but excessive traffic, which should be reduced.
7. Alterations will lead to nothing but the uglification of the bridge.
8. Altering or replacing the existing Fremantle Bridge means diminishing Fremantle.
9. The bridge has stood the test of time for the past 67 years; there's no need for major changes to it.
10. The old bridge will never be able to handle vehicles, bike and pedestrians at the same time.
11. Whatever works are undertaken, the heritage value of the old bridge will be affected.
12. It is worth spending money to retain the iconic status of the bridge.
13. The most important thing is that access to Fremantle from its north is maintained in the most undisturbed manner as possible. 
14. When deciding about the future of the bridge, indigenous concerns should be given adequate consideration. 
15. We should definitely preserve the heritage value of the bridge, but only if it is financially viable.
16. Safe and efficient movement of all road and river users across and under the bridge should the main considerations
17. Providing a better pedestrian and cycle traffic should be the main consideration when deciding about the future of the bridge.
18. The Fremantle Traffic Bridge is the most iconic landmark and the main tourist attraction in Fremantle. 
19. The existing bridge is too low; archways too narrow and do not line up with the railway bridge making navigation dangerous. 
20. The function of the Fremantle Bridge as a transport gateway is more important than its heritage.
21. Tax payers money should be spent on services that are more essential than upgrading the bridge.
22. We shouldn't stick to the past when deciding about the future of the bridge, we should be open for modern design options.
23. Replacing timber elements with steel components would destroy the authentic appearance of the bridge.
24. Any changes to the bridge should give right consideration to the environment.bridge
25. Since the traffic bridge has important heritage significance, the only grounds for its removal should be on the grounds of serious safety issues and verified by heritage engineers.
26. The Fremantle Bridge is irreplaceable. It is a strong, enduring part of our history.
27. We just got traffic calming in Town Centre after 25 years effort. I don't want bridge to be build bigger, better faster to reverse the gains of the last 25 years.
28. As long as there is a bridge that I can cross, I don't care about its structure.
29. River craft deserve better traffic conditions on the Swan River.
30. The bridge is certainly an attractive entry statement to Fremantle and without doubt far more important than trucks.
31. The most important issue for cyclists is safety, which means they need access across the bridge which has a good surface.
32. The critical infrastructure of the bridge raises serious safety concerns. 
33. The main concern is to have a bridge that underpins the economic activities in the region.
34. It is most important that the solution is a long term one.
35. Reducing the risk of vessel collision on the Swan River should be the main consideration when deciding about the future of the bridge

## [Considerations]:
1. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
2. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
3. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
4. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
5. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
6. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
7. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
8. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
9. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
10. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
11. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
12. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
13. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
14. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
15. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
16. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
17. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
18. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
19. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
20. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
2. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
3. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
4. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
5. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
6. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
7. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
8. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
9. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
10. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
11. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
12. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
13. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
14. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
15. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
16. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
17. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
18. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
19. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
20. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
21. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
22. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
23. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
24. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
25. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
26. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
27. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
28. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
29. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
30. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
31. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
32. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
33. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
34. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
35. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
36. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
37. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
38. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
39. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
40. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
41. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
42. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
43. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
2. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
3. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
4. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
5. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
6. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
7. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
8.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
9. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
10. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
11. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
12. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
13. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
14. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
15. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
16. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
17. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
18. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
19. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
20. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
21. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
22. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
23. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
24. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
25. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
26. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
27. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
28. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
29. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
30. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
31. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
32. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
33. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
34. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
35. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
36. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
37. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
38. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
39. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
40. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
41. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
42. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
43. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
44. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
45. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
2. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
3. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
4. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
5. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
6. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
7. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
8. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
9. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process
10. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
11. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
12. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.
13. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
14. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
15. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
16. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
17. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
18. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
19. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
20. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
21. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities
22. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
23. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
24. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
25. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
26. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.
27. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
28. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
29. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
30. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
31. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
32. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
33. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
34. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.
35. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
36. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
2. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
3. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
4. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
5. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
6. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
7. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
8. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
9. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
10. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
11. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
12. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
13. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
14. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
15. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
16. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
17. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
18. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
19. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
20. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
21. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
22. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
23. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
24. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
25. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
26. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
27. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
28. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
29. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
30. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
31. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
32. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
33. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
34. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
35. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.","1. 1

## [Considerations]:
1. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
2. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
3. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
4. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
5. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
6. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
7. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
8. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
9. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
10. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
11. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
12. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
13. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
14. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
15. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
16. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
17. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
18. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
19. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
20. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
21. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
22. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
23. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
24. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
2. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
3. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
4. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
5. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
6. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
7. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
8. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
9. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
10. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
11. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
12. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
13. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
14. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
15. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
16. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
17. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
18. We are a democratic country.
19. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
20. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
21. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
22. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
23. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
24. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
25. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
26. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
27. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
28. We live in a great democracy.
29. I'm always cynical about government processes.
30. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
31. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
32. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
33. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
34. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
35. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
36. People get the government they deserve
37. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
38. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
39. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
40. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
41. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
42. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
43. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
44. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
45. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
46. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
47. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
48. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
2. People get the government they deserve
3. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
4. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
5. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
6. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
7. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
8. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
9. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
10. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
11. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
12. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
13. We are a democratic country.
14. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
15. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
16. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
17. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
18. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
19. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
20. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
21. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
22. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
23. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
24. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
25. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
26. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
27. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
28. I'm always cynical about government processes.
29. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
30. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
31. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
32. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
33. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
34. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
35. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
36. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
37. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
38. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
39. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
40. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
41. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
42. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
43. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
44. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
45. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
46. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
47. We live in a great democracy.
48. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.","1. 8

8. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
9. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
10. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
11. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
12. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
13. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
14. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
15. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
16. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
17. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
18. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
19. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
20. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
21. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
22. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
23. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
24. We are a democratic country.
25. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
26. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
27. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
28. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
29. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
30. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
31. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
32. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
33. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
34. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
35. I'm always cynical about government processes.
36. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
37. People get the government they deserve
38. We live in a great democracy.
39. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
40. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
41. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
42. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
43. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
44. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
45. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
46. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
47. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
48. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.","1. 3

4. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
5. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
6. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
7. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
8. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
9. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
10. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
11. I care about the planet.
12. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
13. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
14. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
15. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
16. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
17. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
18. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
19. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
20. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
21. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
22. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.

## [Considerations]:
1. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
2. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
3. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
4. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
5. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
6. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
7. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
8. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
9. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
10. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
11. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
12. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
13. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
14. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
15. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
16. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
17. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
18. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
19. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
20. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
21. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
22. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
23. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
24. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
25. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
26. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
27. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
28. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
29. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
30. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
31. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
32. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
33. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
34. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
35. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
36. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
37. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
38. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
39. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
40. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
41. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
42. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
43. Forest health means jobs.
44. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
45. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
2. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
3. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
4. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
5. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
6. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
7. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
8. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
9. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
10. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
11. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
12. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
13. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
14. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
15. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
16. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
17. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
18. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
19. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
20. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
21. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
22. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
23. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
24. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
25. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
26. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
27. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
28. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
29. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
30. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
31. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
32. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
33. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
34. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
35. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
36. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
37. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
38. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
39. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
40. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
41. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
42. Forest health means jobs.
43. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
44. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
45. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. ","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. Genetic studies of race on enthocultural communities will lead to the discrimination of those same enthocultural communities. 
2. All participants should be paid for donating their samples to a biobank. 
3. Biobanks need independent review boards to determine who should have access to samples. 
4. Educating people about health issues (e.g. diet and lifestyle changes) promises greater health effects than investing in biobanks.
5. The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  
6. There is no risk to the participants who donate to biobanks.
7. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
8. Genetic research will improve our lives.
9. There is no point in consulting the public about ethical issues in science and technology.
10. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for bothers me. 
11. Genetic information is different from health information. 
12. Everyone should donate samples to a biobank for the benefit of everyone. 
13. Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.
14. Participants who donate their samples for research should be given special access to the treatments and therapies that result from that research. 
15. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies.
16. My personal sample should never be anonymized since I should be informed of important research results.

4. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
5. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
6. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
7. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
8. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
9. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
10. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
11. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
12. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
13. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.

1. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
2. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
3. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
4. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
5. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
6. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
7. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
8. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
9. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
10. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
11. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
12. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
13. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
14. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
15. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
16. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
17. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
18. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
19. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
20. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
21. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
22. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
23. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
24. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
25. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
26. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
27. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
28. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
29. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.

## [Considerations]:
1. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
2. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
3. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
4. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
5. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
6. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
7. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
8. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
9. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
10. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
11. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
12. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
13. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
14. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
15. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
16. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
17. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
18. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
19. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
20. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
21. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
22. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
23. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
24. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
25. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
26. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
27. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
28. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
29. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
30. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.

1. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
2. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
3. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
4. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
5. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
6. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
7. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
8. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
9. It is certain that climate change exists.
10. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
11. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
12. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
13. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
14. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
15. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
16. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
17. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
18. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
19. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
20. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
21. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
22. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
23. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.

## [Considerations]:
1. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
2. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
3. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
4. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
5. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
6. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
7. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
8. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
9. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
10. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
11. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
12. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
13. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
14. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
15. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
16. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
17. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
18. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
19. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
20. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.","1. 7

1. There are not enough mental health services in Switzerland, so their funding should be increased.
2. There should be more integrated mental health clinics that provide a range of services, such as sports or artistic activities in addition to therapy and medication
3. Initiatives focused on improving the socioeconomic conditions of disadvantaged people should be implemented to address mental health disparities.
4. There are enough mental health services in Switzerland, and funding should remain as it is.
5. Private mental health clinics should receive more government funding to allow more people to access them.
6. There are too many mental health services in Switzerland, and they should be reduced.

## [Considerations]:
1. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
2. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
3. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
4. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
5. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
6. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
7. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
8. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
9. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
10. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
11. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
12. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
13. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
14. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
15. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
16. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
17. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
18. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
19. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
20. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
21. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
22. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
23. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
24. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
25. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
26. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
27. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
28. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
29. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
30. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
31. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
32. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
33. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
34. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
35. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
36. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
37. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
38. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
39. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
40. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
41. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.

## [Considerations]:
1. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
2. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
3. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
4. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
5. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
6. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
7. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
8. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
9. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
10. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
11. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
12. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
13. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
14. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
15. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
16. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
17. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
18. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
19. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
20. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
21. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
22. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
23. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
24. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
25. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
26. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
27. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
28. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
29. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
30. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
31. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
32. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
33. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
34. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
35. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
36. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
37. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
38. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
39. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
40. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
41. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
42. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
43. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
2. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
3. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
4. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
5. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
6. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
7. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
8. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
9. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
10. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
11. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
12. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
13. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
14. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
15. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
16. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
17. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
18. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
19. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
20. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
21. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
22. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
23. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
24. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
25. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
26. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
27. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
28. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
29. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
30. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
31. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
32. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
33. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
34.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
35. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
36. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
37. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
38. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
39. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
40. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
41. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
42. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
43. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
44. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
45. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.","1. 7

2. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
3. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
4. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
5. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
6. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
7. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
8. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
9. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
10. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
11. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
12. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
13. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
14.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
15. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
16. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
17. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.

19. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
20. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
21. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
22. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
23. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
24. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
25. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
26. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
27. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
28. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
29. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
30. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
31. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
32. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
33. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
34. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
35. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
36. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
37. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
38. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
39. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
40. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
41. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
42. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
43. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
44. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts.

## [Considerations]:
1. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
2. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
3. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.
4. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
5. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
6. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process
7. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
8. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
9. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
10. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
11. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
12. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
13. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities
14. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
15. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
16. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
17. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
18. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
19. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
20. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
21. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
22. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.
23. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
24. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
25. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
26. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
27. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.
28. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
29. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
30. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
31. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
32. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
33. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
34. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
35. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
36. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.","1. 5

1. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
2. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
3. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
4. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
5. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
6. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
7. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
8. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
9. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
10. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
11. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
12. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
13. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
14. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
15. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
16. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
17. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
18. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
19. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
20. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
21. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
22. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
23. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
24. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
25. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
26. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
27. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
28. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
29. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
30. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
31. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
32. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
33. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
34. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.

3. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
4. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
5. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
6. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
7. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
8. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
9. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
10. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
11. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
12. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
13. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
14. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
15. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
16. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
17. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
18. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
19. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
20. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.

20. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
21. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
22. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
23. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
24. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
25. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
26. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
27. Genome editing is really cool science.
28. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
29. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
30. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
31. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
32. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
33. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
34. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
35. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
36. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
37. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
38. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
39. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
40. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
41. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
42. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
43. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.

## [Considerations]:
1. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
2. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
3. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
4. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
5. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
6. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
7. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
8. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
9. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
10. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
11. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
12. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
13. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
14. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
15. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
16. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
17. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
18. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
19. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
20. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
21. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
22. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
23. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
24. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. The road is just the 'thin edge of the wedge'. This may not happen for a long time, but it will happen.
2. Whilst impacts on locals in the Bloomfield area are a concern, it is the broader community that should carry more weight when deciding what to do with the Bloomfield Track.
3. When it comes to the Bloomfield track, people living in Cairns are in no position to judge what the interests of the local residents of Bloomfield are.
4. Using cars on the Bloomfield Track is bad for the rainforest.
5. I don't really know who benefits most from the protection of Rainforest in the Daintree.
6. If the Bloomfield Track is sealed (bitumenized) there will not be a rapid increase in environmentally damaging development in the Daintree area in the future It may even benefit the environment there.
7. Laying bitumen on the Bloomfield Track would be beneficial for the environment
8. I'm not sure if the future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by locals, outsiders or both.
9. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Daintree region because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
10. The future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by everyone and not just by those who live in the Bloomfield area.
11. The Bloomfield Track may not have been the best idea, but I guess there is probably little point in closing it now that it has been built.
12. I don't know how, but I think that there must be some way in which everybody benefits from protecting the rainforest near the Bloomfield Track.
13. The Bloomfield Track issue is important for Queensland.
14. If future generations could have their say about the Bloomfield track, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
15. I'm concerned that I will be made worse off by any decision about the Bloomfield Track.
16. The more that it is possible for the average North Queensland resident can access the Bloomfield Track the better
17. The Bloomfield Track is important because it allows quick access to remote areas of the North.
18. In deciding on what to do with the Bloomfield Track I don't know whether it's more important to meet the needs of the community or the environment.
19. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track does not cause siltation or damage to the fringing inshore reefs between Cape Tribulation and Cooktown
20. If we don't take steps to protect the Daintree Rainforest future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the area as we do now.
21. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track is permanently damaging the coral reefs that fringe the beaches below
22. I don't know what the people of Bloomfield think about the Bloomfield Track.
23. No development should be permitted in World Heritage areas such as the Daintree.
24. A long term perspective on the Bloomfield Track is essential.
25. The fate of the Bloomfield Track is of no concern to me.
26. Any decision about the Bloomfield Track will greatly affect people like me.
27. I don't like how development is creeping further and further North into the Daintree and beyond because of its effect on the environment.
28. Everyone in Queensland is better off for having a road like the Bloomfield Track.
29. The coral reefs along the foreshore below the Bloomfield Track are not badly affected by the road.
30. Conservation in the Daintree area is worthwhile at whatever cost.
31. I have no idea what the people in the Bloomfield area think about the Bloomfield Track.
32. There is no reason to believe that the Daintree Rainforest is under threat.
33. I don't know if improving the Bloomfield Track would lead to a rapid acceleration of development in the area to the detriment of the environment.

5. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
6. People get the government they deserve
7. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
8. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
9. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
10. We live in a great democracy.
11. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
12. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
13. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
14. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
15. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
16. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
17. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
18. We are a democratic country.
19. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
20. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
21. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
22. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
23. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
24. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
25. I'm always cynical about government processes.
26. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
27. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
28. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
29. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
30. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
31. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
32. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
33. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
34. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
35. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
36. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
37. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
38. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
39. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
40. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
41. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
42. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
43. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
44. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
45. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
46. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
47. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
48. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. ","1. 7

26. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
27. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
28. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
29. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
30. I'm always cynical about government processes.
31. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
32. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
33. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
34. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
35. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
36. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
37. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
38. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
39. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
40. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
41. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
42. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
43. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
44. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
45. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
46. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
47. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
48. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?","1. 7

26. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
27. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
28. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
29. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
30. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
31. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
32. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.

## [Considerations]:
1. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
2. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
3. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
4. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
5. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
6. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
7. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
8. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
9. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
10. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
11. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
12. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
13. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
14. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
15. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
16. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
17. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
18. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
19. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
20. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
21. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
22. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
23. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
24. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
25. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
26. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
27. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
28. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
29. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
30. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
31. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
32. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
33. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
34. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
35. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
36. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
37. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
38. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
39. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
40. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
41. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
42. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
43. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
44. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
45. Forest health means jobs.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
2. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
3. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
4. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
5. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
6. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
7. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
8. Forest health means jobs.
9. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
10. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
11. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
12. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
13. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
14. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
15. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
16. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
17. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
18. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
19. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
20. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
21. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
22. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
23. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
24. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
25. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
26. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
27. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
28. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
29. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
30. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
31. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
32. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
33. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
34. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
35. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
36. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
37. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
38. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
39. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
40. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
41. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
42. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
43. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
44. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
45. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. Biobanks need independent review boards to determine who should have access to samples. 
2. Everyone should donate samples to a biobank for the benefit of everyone. 
3. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health.
4. Scientists should have access to all unidentified, personal samples for research.
5. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for bothers me. 
6. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
7. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.  
8. Participants who donate their samples for research should be given special access to the treatments and therapies that result from that research. 
9. Policy makers should consider the possibility that Canada should not pursue biobanking.
10. Genetic research will improve our lives.
11. Genetic studies of race on enthocultural communities will lead to the discrimination of those same enthocultural communities. 
12. Researchers should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.  
13. Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.
14. I should have property rights to my tissues before or after they leave my body.
15. Participants should be active in the set up and oversight of  biobanks. 
16. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
17. I do not care if my donated sample is connected to my name and medical information.
18. All participants should be paid for donating their samples to a biobank. 
19. Aboriginal communities require special consideration concerning healthcare and research.
20. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies.
21. Biobanks will only lead to expensive treatments and high profits. 
22. I trust researchers to control access to my personal samples.
23. Participants should be contacted every time researchers want to use their samples for research.
24. There is no risk to the participants who donate to biobanks.
25. Genetic information is different from health information. 
26. Participants should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at anytime. 
27. Profits from biobanking should be returned to the donating community. 
28. My personal sample should never be anonymized since I should be informed of important research results.  
29. Educating people about health issues (e.g. diet and lifestyle changes) promises greater health effects than investing in biobanks.
30. It is always permissible to do research on my personally identifiable sample without my prior permission.  
31. If someone is a carrier of a genetic disease, they have a responsibility to participate in genetic research.
32. The priority for healthcare should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
33. Sampling some people in an ethnocultural community is acceptable only if the whole ethnocultural community has agreed to participate.
34. To me, religious communities need to be consulted about genetic and biobank research. 
35. There is no point in consulting the public about ethical issues in science and technology.
36. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government. 
37. Genetic studies of disability will lead to the discrimination of people living with the same conditions.
38. The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  ","1. 9

1. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
2. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
3. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
4. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change.

15. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
16. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
17. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
18. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
19. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
20. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
21. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
22. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
23. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
24. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
25. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
26. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
27. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
28. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.

## [Considerations]:
1. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
2. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
3. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
4. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
5. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
6. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
7. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
8. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
9. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
10. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
11. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
12. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
13. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
14. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
15. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
16. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
17. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
18. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
19. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
20. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
21. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
22. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
23. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
24. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
25. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
26. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
27. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
28. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
29. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
30. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
31. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. ","1. 2

1. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
2. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
3. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
4. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
5. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
6. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
7. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
8. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
9. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
10. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
11. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
12. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
13. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
14. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
15. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
16. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
17. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
18. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
19. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
20. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
21. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
22. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
23. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
24. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
25. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
26. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
27. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
28. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
29. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
30. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
31. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.","1. 7

2. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
3. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
4. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
5. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
6. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
7. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
8. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
9. Food waste is a major environmental issue
10. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
11. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
12. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
13. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
14. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
15. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
16. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
17. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
18. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
19. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
20. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?

4. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
5. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
6. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
7. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
8. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
9. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
10. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.

13. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
14. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
15. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
16. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
17. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
2. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
3. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
4. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
5. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
6. It is certain that climate change exists.
7. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
8. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
9. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
10. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
11. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
12. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
13. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
14. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
15. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
16. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
17. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
18. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
19. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
20. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
21. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
22. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
23. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
24. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
25. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
26. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
27. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
28. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
29. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
30. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
31. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
32. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
33. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
2. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
3. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
4. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
5. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
6. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
7. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
8. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
9. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
10. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
11. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
12. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
13. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
14. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
15. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
16. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
17. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
18. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
19. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
20. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
21. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
22. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
23. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
24. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
25. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
26. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
27. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
28. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
29. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
30. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
31. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
32. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
33. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
34. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
35. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
36. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
37. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
38. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
39. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
40. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
41. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
42. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
43. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
2. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
3. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
4. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
5. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
6. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
7. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
8. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
9. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
10. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
11. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
12. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
13. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
14. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
15. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
16. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
17. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
18. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
19. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
20. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
21. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
22. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
23. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
24. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
25. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
26. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
27. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
28. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
29. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
30. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
31. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
32. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
33. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
34. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
35. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
36. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
37. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
38. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
39. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
40. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
41. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
42. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
43. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
2. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
3. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
4. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
5. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
6.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
7. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
8. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
9. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
10. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
11. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
12. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
13. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
14. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
15. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
16. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
17. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
18. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
19. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
20. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
21. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
22. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
23. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
24. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
25. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
26. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
27. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
28. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
29. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
30. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
31. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.

## [Considerations]:
1. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
2. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
3. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
4. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
5. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
6. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
7. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
8. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
9. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
10. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
11. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
12. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
13. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
14. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
15. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
16. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
17. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
18. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
19. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
20. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
21. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
22. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
23.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
24. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
25. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
26. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
27. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
28. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
29. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
30. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
31. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
32. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
33. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
34. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
35. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
36. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
37. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
38. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
39. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
40. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
41. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
42. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
43. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
44. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
45. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.","1. 8

33. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
34. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine

1. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
2. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
3. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
4. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
5. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
6. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
7. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
8. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
9. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
10. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
11. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
12. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
13. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
14. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
15. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
16. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
17. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
18. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
19. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
20. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
21. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
22. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
23. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
24. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
25. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
26. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
27. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
28. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
29. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
30. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
31. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
32. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
33. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
34. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.

3. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
4. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
5. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
6. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
7. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
8. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
9. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
10. Genome editing is really cool science.
11. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
12. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
13. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
14. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
15. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
16. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
17. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
18. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
19. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
20. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
21. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
22. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
23. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
24. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
25. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
26. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
27. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
28. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
29. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
30. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
31. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
32. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
33. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
34. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
35. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
36. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
37. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
38. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
39. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.

19. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
20. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.

25. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
26. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.

29. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
30. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
31. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
32. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
33. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
34. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
35. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
36. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
37. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
38. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
39. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
40. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.

## [Considerations]:
1. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
2. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
3. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
4. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
5. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
6. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
7. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
8. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
9. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
10. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
11. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
12. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
13. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
14. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
15. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
16. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
17. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
18. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
19. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
20. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.","1. 1

## [Considerations]:
1. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
2. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
3. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
4. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
5. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
6. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
7. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
8. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
9. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
10. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
11. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
12. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
13. People get the government they deserve
14. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.

32. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
33. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.

45. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.

47. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.

## [Considerations]:
1. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
2. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
3. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
4. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
5. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
6. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
7. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
8. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
9. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
10. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
11. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
12. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
13. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
14. I'm always cynical about government processes.
15. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
16. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
17. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
18. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
19. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
20. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
21. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
22. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
23. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
24. People get the government they deserve

29. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
30. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
31. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
32. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
33. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
34. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
35. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
36. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
37. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
38. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
39. We are a democratic country.
40. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
41. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
42. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
43. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
44. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
45. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
46. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
47. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.

1. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
2. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
3. People get the government they deserve
4. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
5. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
6. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
7. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
8. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
9. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
10. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
11. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
12. I'm always cynical about government processes.
13. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
14. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
15. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
16. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
17. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
18. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
19. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
20. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
21. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
22. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
23. We live in a great democracy.
24. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
25. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
26. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
27. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
28. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
29. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
30. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
31. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
32. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
33. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
34. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
35. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
36. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
37. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
38. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
39. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
40. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
41. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
42. We are a democratic country.
43. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
44. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
45. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
46. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
47. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
48. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
2. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
3. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
4. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
5. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
6. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
7. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
8. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
9. We live in a great democracy.
10. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
11. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
12. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
13. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
14. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
15. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
16. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
17. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
18. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
19. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
20. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
21. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
22. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
23. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
24. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
25. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
26. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
27. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
28. People get the government they deserve
29. We are a democratic country.
30. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
31. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
32. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
33. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
34. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
35. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
36. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
37. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
38. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
39. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
40. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
41. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
42. I'm always cynical about government processes.
43. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
44. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
45. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
46. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
47. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
48. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. ","1. 8

5. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
6. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
7. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
8. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
9. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
10. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
11. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
12. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
13. People get the government they deserve
14. We are a democratic country.
15. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
16. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
17. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
18. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
19. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
20. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
21. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
22. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
23. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
24. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
25. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
26. I'm always cynical about government processes.
27. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
28. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
29. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
30. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
31. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
32. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
33. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
34. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
35. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
36. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
37. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
38. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
39. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
40. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
41. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
42. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
43. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
44. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
45. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
46. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
47. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
48. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.","1. 8

35. I'm always cynical about government processes.
36. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
37. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
38. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
39. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.

42. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
43. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
44. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
45. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
46. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
47. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
48. We live in a great democracy.","1. 7

3. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
4. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
5. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
6. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
7. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
8. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
9. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
10. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
11. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
12. I care about the planet.
13. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
14. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
15. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
16. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
17. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
18. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
19. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
20. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
21. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
22. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
23. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
24. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
25. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
26. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
27. We can adapt to the coming changes.
28. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
29. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
30. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.

## [Considerations]:
1. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
2. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
3. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
4. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
5. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
6. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
7. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
8. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
9. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
10. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
11. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
12. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
13. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
14. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
15. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
16. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
17. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
18. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
19. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
20. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
21. We can adapt to the coming changes.
22. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
23. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
24. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
25. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
26. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
27. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
28. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
29. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
30. I care about the planet.
31. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
32. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.

## [Considerations]:
1. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
2. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
3. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
4. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
5. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
6. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
7. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
8. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
9. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
10. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
11. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
12. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
13. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
14. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
15. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
16. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
17. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
18. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
19. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
20. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
21. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
22. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
23. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
24. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
25. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
26. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
27. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
28. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
29. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
30. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
31. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
32. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
33. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
34. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
35. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
36. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
37. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
38. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
39. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
40. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
41. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
42. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.

## [Considerations]:
1. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
2. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
3. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
4. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
5. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
6. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
7. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
8. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
9. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
10. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
11. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
12. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
13. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
14. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
15. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
16. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
17. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
18. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
19. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
20. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
21. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
22. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
23. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
24. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
25. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
26. Forest health means jobs.
27. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
28. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
29. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
30. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
31. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
32. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
33. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
34. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
35. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
36. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
37. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
38. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
39. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
40. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
41. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
42. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
43. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
44. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
45. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
2. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
3. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
4. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
5. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
6. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
7. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
8. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
9. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
10. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
11. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
12. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
13. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
14. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
15. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
16. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
17. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
18. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
19. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
20. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
21. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
22. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
23. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
24. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
25. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
26. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
27. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
28. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
29. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
30. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
31. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
32. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
33. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
34. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
35. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
36. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
37. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
38. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
39. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
40. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
41. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
42. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
43. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
44. Forest health means jobs.
45. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
2. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
3. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
4. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
5. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
6. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
7. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
8. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
9. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
10. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
11. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
12. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
13. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
14. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
15. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
16. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
17. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
18. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
19. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
20. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
21. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
22. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
23. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
24. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
25. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
26. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
27. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
28. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
29. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
30. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
31. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
32. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
33. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
34. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
35. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
36. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
37. Forest health means jobs.
38. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
39. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
40. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
41. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
42. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
43. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
44. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
45. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
2. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
3. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
4. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
5. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
6. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
7. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
8. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
9. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
10. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
11. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
12. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
13. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
14. Forest health means jobs.
15. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
16. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
17. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
18. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
19. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
20. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
21. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
22. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
23. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
24. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
25. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
26. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
27. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
28. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
29. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
30. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
31. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
32. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
33. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
34. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
35. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
36. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
37. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
38. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
39. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
40. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
41. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
42. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
43. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
44. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
45. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. ","1. 8

38. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
39. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
40. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
41. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
42. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
43. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
44. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
45. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. ","1. 8

2. If someone is a carrier of a genetic disease, they have a responsibility to participate in genetic research.
3. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government. 
4. Genetic studies of disability will lead to the discrimination of people living with the same conditions.
5. Biobanks need independent review boards to determine who should have access to samples. 
6. The priority for healthcare should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
7. I trust researchers to control access to my personal samples.
8. I should have property rights to my tissues before or after they leave my body.
9. There is no point in consulting the public about ethical issues in science and technology.
10. Profits from biobanking should be returned to the donating community. 
11. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for bothers me. 
12. Researchers should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.  
13. It is always permissible to do research on my personally identifiable sample without my prior permission.  
14. The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  
15. There is no risk to the participants who donate to biobanks.
16. Genetic studies of race on enthocultural communities will lead to the discrimination of those same enthocultural communities. 
17. All participants should be paid for donating their samples to a biobank. 
18. Participants should be contacted every time researchers want to use their samples for research.
19. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies.
20. Everyone should donate samples to a biobank for the benefit of everyone. 
21. To me, religious communities need to be consulted about genetic and biobank research. 
22. Participants who donate their samples for research should be given special access to the treatments and therapies that result from that research. 
23. Policy makers should consider the possibility that Canada should not pursue biobanking.
24. Sampling some people in an ethnocultural community is acceptable only if the whole ethnocultural community has agreed to participate.
25. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
26. My personal sample should never be anonymized since I should be informed of important research results.  
27. Educating people about health issues (e.g. diet and lifestyle changes) promises greater health effects than investing in biobanks.
28. Participants should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at anytime. 
29. Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.
30. Aboriginal communities require special consideration concerning healthcare and research.
31. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
32. Genetic research will improve our lives.
33. I do not care if my donated sample is connected to my name and medical information.
34. Participants should be active in the set up and oversight of  biobanks. 
35. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health.
36. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.  
37. Genetic information is different from health information. 
38. Scientists should have access to all unidentified, personal samples for research.","1. 5

2. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
3. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
4. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.

1. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
2. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
3. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
4. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
5. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
6. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
7. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
8. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
9. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
10. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
11. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
12. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
13. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
14. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
15. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
16. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
17. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
18. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
19. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
20. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
21. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
22. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
23. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
24. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
25. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
26. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
27. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
28. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
29. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
2. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
3. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
4. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
5. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
6. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
7. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
8. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
9. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
10. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
11. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
12. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
13. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
14. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
15. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
16. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
17. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
18. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
19. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
20. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
21. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
22. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
23. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
24. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
25. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
26. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
27. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
28. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
29. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
30. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.

2. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
3. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
4. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
5. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
6. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
7. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
8. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
9. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
10. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
11. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
12. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
13. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
14. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
15. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
16. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
17. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
18. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
19. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
20. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
21. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
22. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
23. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
24. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
25. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
26. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
27. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
28. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
29. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
30. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
31. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.","1. 6

2. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
3. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
4. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
5. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
6. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
7. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
8. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
9. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
10. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
11. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
12. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
13. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
14. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
15. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
16. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
17. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
18. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
19. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.

23. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
24. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
25. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
26. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
2. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
3. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
4. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
5. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
6. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
7. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
8. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
9. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
10. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
11. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
12. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
13. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
14. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
15. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
16. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
17. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
18. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
19. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
20. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
21. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
22. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
23. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
24. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
25. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.

6. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
7. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
8. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
9. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
10. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
11. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
12. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
13. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
14. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
15. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
16. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
17. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
18. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
19. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
20. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
21. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
22. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
23. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
24. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
25. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
26. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
27. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
28. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
29. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
30. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
31. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.","1. 6

1. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
2. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
3. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
4. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
5. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
6. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
7. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
8. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
9. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
10. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
11. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
12. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
13. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
14. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
15. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
16. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
17. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
18. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
19. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
20. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
21. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
22. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
23. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
24. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
25. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
26. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
27. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
28. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics

1. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
2. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
3. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
4. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
5. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
6. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
7. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
8. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
9. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
10. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
11. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
12. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
13. Food waste is a major environmental issue
14. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
15. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
16. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
17. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
18. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
19. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
20. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
21. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
22. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming

26. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
27. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
28. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
29. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy

1. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
2. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
3. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
4. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
5. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
6. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
7. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
8. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
9. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
10. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
11. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
12. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
13. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
14. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
15. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
16. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
17. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
18. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
19. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
20. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
21. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
22. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
23. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
24. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
25. Food waste is a major environmental issue
26. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
27. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
28. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
29. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics

## [Considerations]:
1. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
2. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
3. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
4. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
5. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
6. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
7. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
8. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
9. Food waste is a major environmental issue
10. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
11. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
12. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
13. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
14. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
15. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
16. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
17. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
18. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
19. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
20. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
21. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
22. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
23. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
24. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
25. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
26. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
27. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
28. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
29. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture

4. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
5. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
6. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
7. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
8. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
9. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
10. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
11. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
12. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
13. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
14. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
15. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
16. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
17. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
18. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
19. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
20. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.

22. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
23. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
24. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
25. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
26. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
27. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
28. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
2. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
3. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
4. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
5. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
6. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
7. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
8. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
9. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
10. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
11. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
12. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
13. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
14. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
15. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
16. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
17. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
18. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
19. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
20. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
21. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
22. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
23. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
24. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
25. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
26. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
27. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
28. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
29. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).

## [Considerations]:
1. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
2. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
3. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
4. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
5. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
6. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
7. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
8. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
9. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
10. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
11. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
12. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
13. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
14. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
15. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
16. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
17. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
18. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
19. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
20. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
21. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
22. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
23. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
24. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
25. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
26. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
27. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
28. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
29. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
30. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
31. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
32. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.","1. 7

1. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
2. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
3. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
4. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
5. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
6. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
7. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
8. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
9. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
10. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
11. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
12. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
13. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
14. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
15. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
16. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
17. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
18. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
19. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
20. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
21. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
22. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
23. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
24. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
25. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
26. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
27. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
28. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.

3. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
4. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
5. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
6. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
7. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.

11. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
12. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.

1. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
2. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
3. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
4. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
5. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
6. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
7. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
8. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
9. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
10. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
11. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.

## [Considerations]:
1. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
2. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
3. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
4. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
5. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
6. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
7. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
8. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
9. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
10. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
11. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
12. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
13. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
14. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
15. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
16. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
17. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
18. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
19. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
20. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
21. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
22. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
23. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
24. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
25. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
26. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
27. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
28. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
29. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
30. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
31. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
32. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
33. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
34. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
35. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
36. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
37. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
38. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
39. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
40. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
41. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
42. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
43. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
2. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
3. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
4. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
5. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
6. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
7. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
8. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
9. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
10. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
11. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
12. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
13. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
14. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
15. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
16. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
17. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
18. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
19. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
20. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
21. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
22. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
23. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
24. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
25. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
26. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
27. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
28. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
29. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
30. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
31. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
32. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
33. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
34. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
35. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
36. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
37. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
38. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
39. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
40. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
41. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
42. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.

## [Considerations]:
1. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
2. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
3. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
4. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
5. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
6. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
7. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
8. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
9. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
10. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
11. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
12. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
13. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
14. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
15. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
16. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
17. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
18. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
19. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
20. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
21. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
22. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
23. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
24. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
25. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
26. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
27. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
28. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
29. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
30. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
31. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
32. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
33. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
34. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
35. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
36. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
37. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
38. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
39. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
40. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
41. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
42. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”

1. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
2. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
3. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
4. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
5. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
6. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
7. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
8. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
9. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
10. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
11. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.

14. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
15. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
16. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
17. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
18. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
19. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
20. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
21. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
22. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
23. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
24. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
25. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
26. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
27. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
28. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
29. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
30. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”

## [Considerations]:
1. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
2. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
3. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
4. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
5. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
6. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
7. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
8. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
9. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
10. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
11. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
12. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
13. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
14. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
15. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
16. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
17. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
18. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
19. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
20. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
21. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
22. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
23. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
24. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
25. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
26. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
27. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
28. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
29. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
30. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
31. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
32. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
33. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
34. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
35. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
36. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
37. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
38. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
39. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
40. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
41. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
42. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
43. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.","1. 4

## [Considerations]:
1. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
2. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
3. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
4. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
5. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
6. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
7. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
8. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
9. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
10. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
11. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
12. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
13. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
14. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
15. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
16. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
17. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
18. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
19. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
20. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
21. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
22. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
23. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
24. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
25. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
26. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
27. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
28. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
29. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
30. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
31. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
32. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
33. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
34. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
35. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
36. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
37. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
38. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
39. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
40. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
41. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
42. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
43. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. ","1. 1

## [Considerations]:
1.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
2. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
3. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
4. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
5. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
6. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
7. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
8. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
9. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
10. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
11. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
12. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
13. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
14. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
15. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
16. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
17. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
18. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
19. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
20. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
21. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
22. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
23. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
24. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
25. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
26. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
27. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
28. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
29. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
30. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
31. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
32. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
33. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
34. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
35. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
36. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
37. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
38. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
39. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
40. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
41. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
42. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
43. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
44. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
45. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
2. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
3. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
4. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
5. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
6. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
7. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
8. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
9. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
10. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
11. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
12. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
13. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
14. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
15. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
16. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
17. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
18. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
19. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
20. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
21. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
22. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
23. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
24. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
25. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
26. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
27. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
28. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
29. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
30. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
31. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
32. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
33. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
34. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
35. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
36. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
37. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
38. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
39. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
40.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
41. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
42. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
43. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
44. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
45. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.","1. 9

35. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
36. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.

38. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
39. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.

## [Considerations]:
1. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
2. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
3. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
4. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
5. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
6. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
7. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
8. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
9. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
10. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
11. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
12. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
13. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
14. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
15. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
16. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
17. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
18. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
19. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
20. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
21. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
22. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
23. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
24. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
25. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
26. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
27. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
28. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
29. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
30.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
31. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
32. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
33. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
34. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
35. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
36. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
37. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
38. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
39. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies.

## [Considerations]:
1. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
2. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
3. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
4. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
5. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
6. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
7. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
8. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
9. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
10. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
11. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
12. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
13. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
14. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
15. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
16. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
17. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
18. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
19. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
20. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
21. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
22. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
23. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
24. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
25. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
26. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
27.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
28. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
29. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
30. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
31. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
32. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
33. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
34. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
35. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
36. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
37. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
38. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
39. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
40. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
41. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
42. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
43. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
44. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
45. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. ","1. 2

5. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
6. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
7. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
8. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
9. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
10. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
11. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
12. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
13. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
14. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
15. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
16. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
17. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
18. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
19. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
20. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
21. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
22. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
23. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
24. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
25. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
26. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
27. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
28. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
29. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
30. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
31. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
32. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
33. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
34. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
35. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
36.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
37. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
38. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
39. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
40. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
41. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
42. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
43. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
44. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
45. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.","1. 10

## [Considerations]:
1. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
2. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
3. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
4. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
5. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
6.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
7. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
8. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
9. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
10. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
11. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
12. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
13. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
14. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
15. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
16. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
17. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
18. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
19. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
20. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
21. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
22. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
23. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
24. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
25. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
26. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
27. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
28. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
29. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
30. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
31. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
32. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
33. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
34. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
35. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
36. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
37. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
38. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
39. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
40. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
41. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
42. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
43. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
44. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.

## [Considerations]:
1. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
2. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
3. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
4. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
5. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
6. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
7. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
8. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
9. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
10. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
11. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
12. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
13. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
14. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
15. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
16. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
17. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
18. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
19. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
20. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
21. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
22. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
23. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
24. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
25. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
26. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
27. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
28. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
29. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
30. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
31. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
32. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
33. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
34. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
35. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
36. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
37. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
38. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
39. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
40. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
41. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
42.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
43. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
44. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
45. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.","1. 6

10. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
11. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.

1. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
2. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
3. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
4. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
5. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process
6. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.
7. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
8. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
9. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
10. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
11. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
12. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
13. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
14. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
15. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.
16. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.
17. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
18. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
19. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
20. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
21. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
22. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
23. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
24. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities
25. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
26. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
27. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
28. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
29. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
30. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
31. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
32. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
33. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
34. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
35. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete

2. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
3. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
4. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
5. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
6. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
7. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
8. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
9. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
10. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
11. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
12. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
13. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
14. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.
15. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
16. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
17. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
18. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
19. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
20. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
21. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
22. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
23. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process
24. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
25. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
26. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat

33. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
34. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.
35. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.

1. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
2. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
3. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
4. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
5. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
6. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
7. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
8. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
9. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
10. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
11. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
12. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
13. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
14. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
15. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
16. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
17. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
18. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
19. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
20. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
21. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
22. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
23. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
24. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
25. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
26. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
27. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
28. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
29. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
30. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef.

## [Considerations]:
1. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
2. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
3. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
4. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
5. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
6. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
7. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
8. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
9. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
10. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
11. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
12. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
13. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
14. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
15. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
16. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
17. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
18. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
19. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
20. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
21. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
22. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
23. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
24. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
25. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
26. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
27. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
28. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
29. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
30. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
31. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
32. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
33. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
34. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.

## [Considerations]:
1. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
2. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
3. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
4. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
5. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
6. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
7. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
8. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
9. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
10. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
11. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
12. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
13. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
14. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
15. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
16. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
17. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
18. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
19. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
20. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
21. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
22. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
23. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
24. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
25. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
26. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
27. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
28. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
29. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
30. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
31. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
32. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
33. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.

## [Considerations]:
1. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
2. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
3. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
4. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
5. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
6. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
7. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
8. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
9. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
10. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
11. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
12. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
13. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
14. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
15. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
16. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
17. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
18. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
19. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
20. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
21. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
22. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
23. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
24. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
25. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
26. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
27. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
28. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
29. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
30. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
31. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
32. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
33. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
34. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
2. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
3. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
4. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
5. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
6. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
7. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
8. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
9. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
10. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
11. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
12. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
13. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
14. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
15. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
16. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
17. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
18. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
19. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
20. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
21. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
22. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
23. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
24. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
25. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
26. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
27. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
28. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
29. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
30. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
31. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
32. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
33. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
34. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
35. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
2. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
3. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
4. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
5. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
6. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
7. Genome editing is really cool science.
8. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
9. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
10. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
11. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
12. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
13. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
14. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
15. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
16. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
17. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
18. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
19. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
20. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
21. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
22. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
23. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
24. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
25. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
26. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
27. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
28. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
29. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
30. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
31. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
32. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
33. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
34. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
35. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
36. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
37. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
38. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
39. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
40. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
41. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
42. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
43. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
44. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.

4. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
5. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
6. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
7. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
8. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
9. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.

18. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
19. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
20. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
21. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
22. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
23. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
24. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.

26. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
27. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
28. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
29. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
30. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
31. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
32. Genome editing is really cool science.

3. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
4. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
5. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
6. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
7. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
8. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
9. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
10. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
11. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
12. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
13. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
14. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
15. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
16. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
17. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
18. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
19. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
20. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
21. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
22. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
23. Genome editing is really cool science.
24. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
25. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
26. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
27. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
28. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
29. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
30. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
31. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
32. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
33. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
34. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
35. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
36. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
37. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
38. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
39. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
40. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
41. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
42. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
43. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.

## [Considerations]:
1. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
2. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
3. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
4. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
5. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
6. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
7. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
8. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
9. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
10. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
11. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
12. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
13. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
14. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
15. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
16. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
17. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
18. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
19. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
20. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
21. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
22. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
23. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
24. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
2. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
3. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
4. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
5. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
6. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
7. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
8. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
9. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
10. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
11. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
12. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
13. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
14. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
15. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
16. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
17. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
18. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
19. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
20. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
21. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
22. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
23. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
24. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
2. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
3. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
4. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
5. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
6. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
7. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
8. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
9. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
10. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
11. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
12. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
13. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
14. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
15. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
16. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
17. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
18. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
19. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
20. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
21. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
22. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
23. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
24. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.","1. 6

1. A universal, public, and unified healthcare system, where people pay according to their income, would ensure healthcare access for everyone.
2. Less government regulation and more private competition would make healthcare more efficient and cost-effective.
3. No changes are needed to the current healthcare system, as it functions well as it is.
4. Fixing financial inefficiencies in the healthcare system could save a lot of money without major changes to the system.
5. Encouraging more personal responsibility by abolishing mandatory health insurance and increasing out-of-pocket payments.
6. More government control over pricing and greater financial support (e.g., individual premium subsidies) would help those in need.","1. 4

## [Considerations]:
1. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
2. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
3. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
4. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
5. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
6. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
7. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
8. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
9. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
10. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
11. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
12. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
13. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
14. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
15. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
16. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
17. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
18. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
19. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
20. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
21. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
22. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
23. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
24. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
25. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
26. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
27. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
28. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
29. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
30. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
31. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
32. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
33. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
34. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
35. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
36. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
37. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
38. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
39. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
40. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
41. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
42. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
43. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
44. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
45. Genetic research will improve our lives.

## [Considerations]:
1. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
2. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
3. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
4. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
5. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
6. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
7. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
8. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
9. Genetic research will improve our lives.
10. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
11. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
12. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
13. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
14. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
15. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
16. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
17. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
18. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
19. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
20. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
21. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
22. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
23. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
24. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
25. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
26. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
27. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
28. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
29. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
30. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
31. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
32. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
33. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
34. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
35. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
36. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
37. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
38. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
39. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
40. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
41. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
42. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
43. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
44. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
45. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
46. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
47. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
48. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
49. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.","1. 7

22. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
23. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
24. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
25. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
26. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
27. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
28. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
29. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
30. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
31. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
32. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
33. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
34. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
35. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
36. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
37. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
38. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
39. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
40. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
41. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
42. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
43. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
44. Genetic research will improve our lives.
45. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
46. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
47. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
48. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.

5. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
6. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
7. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
8. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
9. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
10. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
11. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
12. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
13. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
14. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
15. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.

## [Considerations]:
1. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
2. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
3. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
4. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
5. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
6. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
7. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
8. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
9. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
10. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
11. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
12. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
13. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
14. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
15. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
16. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
17. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
18. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
19. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
20. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
21. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
22. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
23. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
24. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
25.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
26. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
27. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
28. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
29. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
30. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
31. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
32. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
33. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
34. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
35. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
36. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
37. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
38. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
39. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
40. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
41. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
42. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
43. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
44. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
45. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.","1. 8
