It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.,C6. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.,C7. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.,"C8. I don't know what to do.

I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.",C11.
