## [Considerations]:
1. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
2. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
3. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
4. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
5. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
6. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
7. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
8. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
9. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
10. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
11. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
12. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
13. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
14. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
15. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
16. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
17. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
18. We are a democratic country.
19. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
20. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
21. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
22. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
23. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
24. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
25. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
26. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
27. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
28. We live in a great democracy.
29. I'm always cynical about government processes.
30. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
31. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
32. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
33. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
34. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
35. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
36. People get the government they deserve
37. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
38. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
39. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
40. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
41. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
42. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
43. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
44. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
45. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
46. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
47. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
48. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.","1. 4

13. We are a democratic country.
14. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
15. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.

18. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
19. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
20. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
21. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
22. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
23. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
24. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
25. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.

27. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
28. I'm always cynical about government processes.
29. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
30. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
31. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
32. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
33. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
34. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
35. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
36. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
37. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
38. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
39. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
40. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
41. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
42. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
43. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
44. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
45. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
46. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.

26. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
27. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
28. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
29. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
30. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
31. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
32. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
33. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
34. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
35. I'm always cynical about government processes.
36. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
37. People get the government they deserve
38. We live in a great democracy.
39. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
40. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
41. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
42. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
43. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
44. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
45. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
46. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
47. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
48. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.","1. 5

1. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
2. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
3. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
4. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
5. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
6. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
7. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
8. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
9. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
10. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
11. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
12. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
13. I care about the planet.
14. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
15. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
16. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
17. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
18. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
19. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
20. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
21. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
22. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
23. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
24. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
25. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
26. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
27. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
28. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
29. We can adapt to the coming changes.

## [Considerations]:
1. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
2. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
3. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
4. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
5. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
6. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
7. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
8. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
9. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
10. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
11. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
12. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
13. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
14. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
15. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
16. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
17. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
18. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
19. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
20. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
21. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
22. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
23. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
24. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
25. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
26. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
27. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
28. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
29. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
30. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
31. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
32. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
33. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
34. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
35. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
36. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
37. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
38. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
39. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
40. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
41. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
42. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
43. Forest health means jobs.
44. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
45. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.","1. 4

## [Considerations]:
1. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
2. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
3. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
4. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
5. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
6. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
7. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
8. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
9. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
10. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
11. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
12. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
13. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
14. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
15. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
16. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
17. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
18. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
19. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
20. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
21. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
22. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
23. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
24. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
25. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
26. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
27. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
28. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
29. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
30. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
31. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
32. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
33. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
34. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
35. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
36. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
37. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
38. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
39. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
40. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
41. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
42. Forest health means jobs.
43. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
44. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
45. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. ","1. 7

2. All participants should be paid for donating their samples to a biobank. 
3. Biobanks need independent review boards to determine who should have access to samples. 
4. Educating people about health issues (e.g. diet and lifestyle changes) promises greater health effects than investing in biobanks.
5. The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  
6. There is no risk to the participants who donate to biobanks.
7. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
8. Genetic research will improve our lives.
9. There is no point in consulting the public about ethical issues in science and technology.
10. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for bothers me. 
11. Genetic information is different from health information. 
12. Everyone should donate samples to a biobank for the benefit of everyone. 
13. Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.
14. Participants who donate their samples for research should be given special access to the treatments and therapies that result from that research. 
15. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies.
16. My personal sample should never be anonymized since I should be informed of important research results.

19. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government. 
20. Participants should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at anytime. 
21. I trust researchers to control access to my personal samples.
22. Scientists should have access to all unidentified, personal samples for research.
23. Policy makers should consider the possibility that Canada should not pursue biobanking.
24. I do not care if my donated sample is connected to my name and medical information.
25. The priority for healthcare should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
26. To me, religious communities need to be consulted about genetic and biobank research. 
27. I should have property rights to my tissues before or after they leave my body.
28. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health.
29. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.  
30. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
31. It is always permissible to do research on my personally identifiable sample without my prior permission.  
32. Genetic studies of disability will lead to the discrimination of people living with the same conditions.
33. Aboriginal communities require special consideration concerning healthcare and research.
34. Biobanks will only lead to expensive treatments and high profits. 
35. Sampling some people in an ethnocultural community is acceptable only if the whole ethnocultural community has agreed to participate.

## [Considerations]:
1. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
2. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
3. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
4. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
5. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
6. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
7. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
8. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
9. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
10. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
11. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
12. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
13. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
14. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
15. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
16. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
17. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
18. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
19. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
20. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
21. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
22. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
23. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
24. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
25. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
26. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
27. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
28. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.

1. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
2. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
3. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
4. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
5. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
6. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
7. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
8. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
9. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
10. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
11. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
12. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
13. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
14. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
15. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
16. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
17. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
18. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
19. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
20. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
21. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
22. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
23. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
24. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
25. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
26. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
27. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
28. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
29. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
30. It is certain to say that climate change exists.

1. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
2. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
3. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
4. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
5. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
6. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
7. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
8. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
9. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
10. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
11. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
12. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
13. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
14. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
15. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
16. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
17. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
18. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
19. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
20. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
21. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
22. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
23. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
24. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
25. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
26. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
27. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
28. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
29. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
30. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
31. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
32. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
33. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.

## [Considerations]:
1. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
2. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
3. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process
4. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
5. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
6. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
7. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
8. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
9. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.
10. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
11. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.
12. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
13. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
14. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
15. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
16. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
17. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
18. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
19. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
20. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
21. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
22. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
23. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
24. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
25. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.
26. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities
27. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
28. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
29. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
30. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
31. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
32. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
33. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
34. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
35. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
36. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
2. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
3. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
4. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
5. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
6. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
7. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
8. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
9. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
10. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
11. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
12. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
13. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
14. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
15. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
16. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
17. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
18. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
19. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
20. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
21. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
22. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
23. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
24. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
25.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
26. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
27. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
28. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
29. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
30. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
31. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
32. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
33. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
34. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
35. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
36. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
37. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
38. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
39. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
40. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
41. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
42. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
43. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
44. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
45. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.","1. 7

2. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
3. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
4. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
5. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
6. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
7. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
8. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
9.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
10. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
11. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
12. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
13. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
14. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
15. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
16. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
17. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
18. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
19. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
20. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
21. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
22. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
23. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
24. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
25. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
26. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
27. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
28. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
29. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
30. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
31. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
32. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
33. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
34. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
35. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
36. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
37. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
38. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
39. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
40. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
41. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
42. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
43. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
44. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
45. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
2. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
3. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
4. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
5. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
6. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
7. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
8. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
9. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
10. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
11. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
12. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
13. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
14. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
15. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
16. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
17. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
18. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
19. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
20. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
21. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
22. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
23. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
24. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
25. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
26. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
27. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
28. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
29. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
30. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
31. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
32. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
33. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
2. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
3. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
4. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
5. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
6. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
7. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
8. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
9. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
10. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
11. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
12. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
13. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
14. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
15. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
16. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
17. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
18. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
19. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
20. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
21. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
22. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
23. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
24. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
25. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
26. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
27. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
28. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
29. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
30. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
31. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
32. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
33. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
34. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
35. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
36. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
37. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
38. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
39. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
40. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”

## [Considerations]:
1. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
2. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
3. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
4. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
5. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
6. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
7. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
8. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
9. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
10. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
11. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
12. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
13. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
14. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
15. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
16. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
17. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
18. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
19. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
20. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
21. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
22. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
23. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
24. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
25. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
26. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
27. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
28. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
29. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
30. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
31. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
32. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
33. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
34. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
35. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
36. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
37. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
38. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
39. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
40. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
41. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
42. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
43. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
2. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
3. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
4. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
5. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
6. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
7. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
8. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
9. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
10. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
11. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
12. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
13. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
14. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
15. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
16. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
17. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
18. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
19. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
20. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
21. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
22. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
23. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
24. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
25. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.

## [Considerations]:
1. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
2. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
3. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
4. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
5. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
6. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
7. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
8. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
9. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
10. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
11. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
12. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
13. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
14. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
15. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
16. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
17. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
18. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
19. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
20. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
21. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
22. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
23. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
24. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
25. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
26. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
27. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
28. Food waste is a major environmental issue
29. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.

1. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
2. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
3. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
4. It is certain that climate change exists.
5. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
6. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
7. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
8. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
9. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
10. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
11. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
12. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
13. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
14. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
15. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
16. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
17. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
18. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
19. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
20. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
21. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
22. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
23. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
24. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
25. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
26. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
27. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
28. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
29. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
30. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.

## [Considerations]:
1. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
2. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
3. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
4. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
5. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
6. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
7. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
8. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
9. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
10. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
11. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
12. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
13. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
14. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
15. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
16. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
17. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
18. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
19. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
20. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
21. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
22. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
23. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
24. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
25. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
26. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
27. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
28. Food waste is a major environmental issue
29. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
30. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products","1. 3

## [Considerations]:
1. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
2. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
3. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
4. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
5. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
6. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
7. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
8. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
9. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
10. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
11. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
12. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
13. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
14. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
15. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
16. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
17. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
18. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
19. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
20. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
21. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
22. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
23. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
24. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
2. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
3. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
4. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
5. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
6. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
7. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
8. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
9. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
10. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
11. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
12. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
13. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
14. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
15. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
16. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
17. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
18. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
19. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
20. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.","1. 1

## [Considerations]:
1. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
2. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
3. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
4. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
5. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
6. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
7. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
8. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
9. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
10. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
11. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
12. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
13. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
14. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
15. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
16. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
17. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
18. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
19. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
20. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.","1. 2
