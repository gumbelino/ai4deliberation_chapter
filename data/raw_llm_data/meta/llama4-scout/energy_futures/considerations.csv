cuid,created_at,provider,model,temperature,input_tokens,output_tokens,C1. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.,"C2. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.",C3. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.,C4. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.,C5. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. ,C6. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.,C7. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.,"C8. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. ","C9. Wind power has its downsides â€” it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	",C10. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.,C11. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).,C12. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.,C13. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.,"C14. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.",C15. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.,"C16. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.","C17. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.",C18. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.,C19. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.,"C20. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.",C21. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.,"C22.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.","C23. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.",C24. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.,"C25. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.","C26. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.","C27. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. ",C28. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.,C29. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.,"C30. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.",C31. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.,C32. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.,C33. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.,"C34. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.","C35. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.","C36. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.",C37. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.,C38. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.,C39. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.,C40. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.,C41. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.,"C42. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.","C43. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.",C44. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.,C45. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
