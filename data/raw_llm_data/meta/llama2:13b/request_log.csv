1. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
2. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
3. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
4. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
5. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
6. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
7. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
8. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
9. We live in a great democracy.
10. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
11. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
12. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
13. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
14. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
15. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
16. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
17. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
18. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
19. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
20. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
21. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
22. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
23. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
24. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
25. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
26. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
27. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
28. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
29. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
30. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
31. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
32. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
33. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
34. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
35. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
36. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
37. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
38. I'm always cynical about government processes.
39. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
40. People get the government they deserve
41. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
42. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
43. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
44. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
45. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
46. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.

## [Considerations]:
1. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
2. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
3. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
4. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
5. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
6. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
7. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
8. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
9. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
10. I'm always cynical about government processes.
11. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
12. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
13. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
14. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
15. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
16. We are a democratic country.
17. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
18. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
19. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
20. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
21. People get the government they deserve
22. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
23. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
24. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
25. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
26. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
27. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
28. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
29. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
30. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
31. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
32. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
33. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
34. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
35. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
36. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
37. We live in a great democracy.
38. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
39. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
40. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
41. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
42. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
43. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
44. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
45. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
46. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
47. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.

## [Considerations]:
1. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
2. People get the government they deserve
3. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
4. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
5. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
6. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
7. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
8. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
9. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
10. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
11. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
12. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
13. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
14. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
15. We live in a great democracy.
16. I'm always cynical about government processes.
17. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
18. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
19. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
20. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
21. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
22. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
23. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
24. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
25. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
26. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
27. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
28. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
29. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
30. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
31. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
32. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
33. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
34. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
35. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
36. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
37. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
38. We are a democratic country.
39. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
40. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
41. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
42. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
43. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
44. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
45. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
46. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.

## [Considerations]:
1. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
2. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
3. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
4. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
5. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
6. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
7. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
8. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
9. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
10. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
11. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
12. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
13. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
14. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
15. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
16. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
17. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
18. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
19. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
20. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
21. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
22. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
23. People get the government they deserve
24. We are a democratic country.
25. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
26. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
27. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
28. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
29. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
30. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
31. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
32. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
33. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
34. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
35. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
36. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
37. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
38. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
39. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
40. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
41. We live in a great democracy.
42. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
43. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
44. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
45. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
46. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.

1. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
2. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
3. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
4. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
5. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
6. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
7. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
8. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
9. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
10. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
11. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
12. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
13. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
14. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
15. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
16. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
17. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
18. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
19. I care about the planet.
20. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
21. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
22. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
23. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
24. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
25. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
26. We can adapt to the coming changes.
27. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
28. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
29. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
30. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
31. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
32. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.

1. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
2. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
3. We can adapt to the coming changes.
4. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
5. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
6. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
7. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
8. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
9. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
10. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
11. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
12. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
13. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
14. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
15. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
16. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
17. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
18. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
19. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
20. I care about the planet.
21. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
22. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
23. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
24. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
25. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
26. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
27. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
28. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
29. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
30. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
31. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
32. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.

## [Considerations]:
1. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
2. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
3. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
4. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
5. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
6. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
7. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
8. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
9. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
10. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
11. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
12. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
13. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
14. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
15. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
16. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
17. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
18. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
19. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
20. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
21. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
22. Forest health means jobs.
23. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
24. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
25. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
26. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
27. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
28. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
29. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
30. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
31. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
32. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
33. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
34. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
35. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
36. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
37. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
38. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
39. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
40. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
41. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
42. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
43. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
44. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
45. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.",  Sure,1411,2

38. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
39. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
40. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
41. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
42. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
43. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
44. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
45. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.","  Here are the ratings for each of the 45 considerations, rated on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 11 (strongly agree):

31. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
32. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
33. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
34. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
35. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
36. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
37. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
38. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
39. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
40. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
41. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
42. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
43. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
44. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
45. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. ",  Sure,1411,2

1. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
2. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
3. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
4. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
5. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
6. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
7. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
8. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
9. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
10. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
11. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
12. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
13. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
14. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
15. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
16. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
17. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
18. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
19. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
20. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
21. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
22. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
23. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
24. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
25. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.

1. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
2. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
3. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
4. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
5. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
6. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
7. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
8. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
9. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
10. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
11. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
12. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
13. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
14. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
15. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
16. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
17. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
18. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
19. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
20. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change.

1. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
2. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
3. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
4. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
5. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
6. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
7. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
8. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
9. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
10. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
11. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
12. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
13. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
14. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
15. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
16. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
17. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
18. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
19. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
20. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
21. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
22. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
23. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
24. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
25. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
26. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.

1. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
2. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
3. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
4. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
5. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
6. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
7. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
8. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
9. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
10. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
11. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
12. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
13. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
14. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
15. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
16. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
17. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
18. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.

1. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
2. Food waste is a major environmental issue
3. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
4. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
5. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
6. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
7. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
8. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
9. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
10. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
11. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
12. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
13. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
14. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
15. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
16. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
17. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
18. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
19. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
20. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
21. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
22. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
23. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
24. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
25. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
26. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
27. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.

2. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
3. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
4. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
5. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
6. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
7. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
8. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
9. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
10. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
11. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
12. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
13. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
14. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
15. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
16. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
17. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
18. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
19. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
20. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
21. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
22. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
23. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
24. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
25. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
26. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
27. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
28. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
29. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
30. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
31. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.

2. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
3. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
4. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
5. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.

7. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
8. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
9. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
10. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
11. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
12. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
13. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
14. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
15. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
16. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
17. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
18. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
19. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.

5. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
6. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
7. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
8. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
9. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
10. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
11. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
12. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.

15. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
16. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
17. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
18. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
19. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
20. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
21. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.

12. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
13. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
14. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.

16. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
17. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
18. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
19. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
20. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
21. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
22. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.

2. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
3. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
4. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
5. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
6. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
7. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
8. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
9. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
10. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
11. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
12. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
13. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
14. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
15. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
16. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
17. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
18. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
19. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
20. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
21. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
22. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
23. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
24. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
25. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
26. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
27. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
28. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
29. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
30. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
31. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
32. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
33. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
34. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
35. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
36. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
37. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
38. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
39. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
40. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
41. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change.

1. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
2. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
3. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
4. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
5. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
6. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
7. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
8. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
9. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
10. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
11. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
12. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
13. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
14. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
15. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
16. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
17. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
18. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
19. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
20. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
21. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
22. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
23. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
24. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
25. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
26. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
27. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
28. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
29. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
30. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
31. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
32. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
33. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
34. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
35. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
36. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
37. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
38. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
39. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.

1. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
2. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
3. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
4. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
5. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
6. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
7. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
8. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
9. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
10. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
11. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
12. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
13. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
14. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
15. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
16. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
17. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
18. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
19. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
20. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
21. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
22. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
23. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
24. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
25. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
26. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
27. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
28. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
29. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
30. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
31. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
32. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
33. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
34. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
35. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
36. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
37. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
38. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
39. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
40. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
41. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”

## [Considerations]:
1. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
2. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
3. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
4. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
5. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
6. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
7. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
8. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
9. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
10. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
11. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
12. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
13. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
14. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
15. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
16. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
17. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
18. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
19. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
20. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
21.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
22. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
23. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
24. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
25. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
26. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
27. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
28. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
29. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
30. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
31. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
32. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
33. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
34. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
35. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
36. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
37. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
38. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
39. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
40. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
41. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
42. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
43. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.

## [Considerations]:
1. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
2. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
3. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
4. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
5. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
6. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
7. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
8. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
9. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
10. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
11. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
12. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
13. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
14. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
15. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
16. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
17. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
18. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
19. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
20. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
21. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
22. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
23. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
24. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
25. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
26. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
27. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
28. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
29. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
30. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
31. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
32. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
33. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
34. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
35.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
36. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
37. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
38. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
39. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
40. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
41. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
42. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
43. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
44. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.

## [Considerations]:
1. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
2. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
3. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
4. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
5. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
6. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
7. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
8. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
9. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
10. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
11. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
12. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
13. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
14. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
15. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
16. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
17. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
18. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
19. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
20. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
21. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
22. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
23. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
24. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
25. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
26. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
27. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
28. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
29. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
30. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
31. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
32. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
33. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
34. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
35. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
36. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
37.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
38. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
39. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
40. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
41. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
42. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
43. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.

## [Considerations]:
1. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
2. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
3. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
4. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
5. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
6. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
7. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
8. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
9. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
10. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
11. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
12. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
13. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
14. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
15. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
16. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
17. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
18. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
19. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
20. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
21. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
22. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
23. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
24. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
25. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
26. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
27. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
28. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
29. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
30. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
31. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
32. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
33. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
34. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
35. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
36. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
37. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
38. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
39. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
40. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
41.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
42. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
43. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.

## [Considerations]:
1. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
2. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
3. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
4. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
5. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
6. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
7. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
8. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
9. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
10. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
11. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
12. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
13. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
14. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
15. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
16. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
17. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
18. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
19. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
20. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
21. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
22. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
23. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
24. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
25. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
26. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
27. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
28. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
29. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
30. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
31. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
32. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
33. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
34.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
35. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
36. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
37. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
38. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
39. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
40. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
41. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
42. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
43. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).

## [Considerations]:
1. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
2. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
3. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
4. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
5. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
6. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
7. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
8. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
9. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
10. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
11. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
12. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
13. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
14. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
15. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
16. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
17. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
18. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
19. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
20. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
21. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
22. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
23. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
24. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
25. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
26. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
27. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
28. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
29. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
30. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
31. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
32. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
33. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
34. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
35. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
36. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
37. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
38. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
39.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
40. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
41. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
42. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
43. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.

## [Considerations]:
1. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
2. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
3. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
4. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
5. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
6. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
7. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
8. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
9. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
10. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
11. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
12. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
13. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
14. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
15. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
16. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
17. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
18. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
19. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
20. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
21. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
22. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
23. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
24. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
25. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
26. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
27. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
28. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
29. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
30. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
31. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
32.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
33. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
34. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
35. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
36. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
37. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
38. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
39. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
40. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
41. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
42. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
43. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.

## [Considerations]:
1. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
2. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
3. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
4. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
5. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
6. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
7. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
8. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
9. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
10. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
11. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
12. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
13. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
14. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
15. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
16. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
17. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
18. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
19. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
20. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
21. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
22. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
23. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
24. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
25. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
26. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
27. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
28. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
29. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
30. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
31. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
32.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
33. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
34. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
35. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
36. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
37. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
38. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
39. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
40. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
41. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
42. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.

## [Considerations]:
1. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
2. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
3. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
4. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
5. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
6. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
7. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
8. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
9. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
10. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
11. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
12. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
13. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
14. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
15. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
16. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
17. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
18. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
19. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
20. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
21. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
22. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
23. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
24. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
25. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
26. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
27. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
28. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
29. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
30. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
31. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
32. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
33. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
34. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
35. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.",  Sure,1095,2

## [Considerations]:
1. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
2. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
3. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
4. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
5. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
6. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
7. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
8. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
9. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
10. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
11. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
12. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
13. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
14. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
15. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
16. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
17. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
18. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
19. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
20. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
21. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
22. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
23. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
24. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
25. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
26. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
27. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
28. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
29. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
30. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
31. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
32. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
33. Townsville is better off because of mining development.

## [Considerations]:
1. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
2. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
3. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
4. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
5. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
6. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
7. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
8. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
9. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
10. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
11. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
12. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
13. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
14. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
15. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
16. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
17. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
18. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
19. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
20. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
21. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
22. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
23. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
24. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
25. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
26. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
27. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
28. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
29. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
30. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
31. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
32. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
33. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.

2. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
3. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
4. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
5. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
6. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
7. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
8. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
9. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
10. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
11. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
12. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does.

14. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
15. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
16. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
17. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
18. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
19. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
20. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
21. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
22. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.

24. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
25. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
26. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
27. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
28. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
29. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
30. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
31. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
32. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
33. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.

30. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
31. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
32. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
33. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
34. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
35. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. ",  Sure,1095,2

4. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
5. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
6. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
7. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.

9. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
10. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
11. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
12. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
13. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
14. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
15. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
16. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
17. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
18. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
19. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.

1. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
2. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
3. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
4. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
5. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
6. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
7. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
8. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
9. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
10. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
11. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
12. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
13. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
14. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
15. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
16. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
17. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
18. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
19. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
20. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
21. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
22. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
23. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
24. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
25. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
26. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
27. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
28. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
29. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
30. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
31. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
32. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
33. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
34. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.

36. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
37. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
38. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
39. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
40. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
41. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
42. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet.

## [Considerations]:
1. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
2. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
3. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
4. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
5. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
6. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
7. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
8. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
9. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
10. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
11. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
12. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
13. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
14. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
15. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
16. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
17. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
18. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
19. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
20. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
21. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
22. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
23. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
24. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
25. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
26. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
27. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
28. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
29. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
30. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
31. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
32. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
33. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
34. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
35. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
36. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
37. Genetic research will improve our lives.
38. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
39. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
40. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
41. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
42. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
43. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
44. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
45. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
46. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
47. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
48. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
49. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.",  Sure,1367,2
