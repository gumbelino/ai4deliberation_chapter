## [Considerations]:
1. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
2. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
3. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
4. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
5. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
6. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
7. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
8. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
9. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
10. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
11. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
12. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
13. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
14. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
15. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
16. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
17. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
18. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
19. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
20. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
21. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
22. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
23. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
24. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
25. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
26. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
27. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
28. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
29. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
30. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
31. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
32. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
33. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
34. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
35. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
36. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
37. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
38. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
39. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
40. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
41. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
42. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
43. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. When it comes to the Bloomfield Track, it's not important to worry about what the future will hold
2. A long term perspective on the Bloomfield Track is essential.
3. In deciding on what to do with the Bloomfield Track I don't know whether it's more important to meet the needs of the community or the environment.
4. Using cars on the Bloomfield Track is bad for the rainforest.
5. No development should be permitted in World Heritage areas such as the Daintree.
6. The coral reefs along the foreshore below the Bloomfield Track are not badly affected by the road.
7. Whilst impacts on locals in the Bloomfield area are a concern, it is the broader community that should carry more weight when deciding what to do with the Bloomfield Track.
8. I would be worse off if more of the Daintree rainforest is protected.
9. If the Bloomfield Track is sealed (bitumenized) there will not be a rapid increase in environmentally damaging development in the Daintree area in the future It may even benefit the environment there.
10. The Bloomfield Track may not have been the best idea, but I guess there is probably little point in closing it now that it has been built.
11. I'm not sure if the future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by locals, outsiders or both.
12. Everyone in Queensland is better off for having a road like the Bloomfield Track.
13. The road is just the 'thin edge of the wedge'. This may not happen for a long time, but it will happen.
14. Conservation in the Daintree area is worthwhile at whatever cost.
15. When it comes to the Bloomfield track, people living in Cairns are in no position to judge what the interests of the local residents of Bloomfield are.
16. Any decision about the Bloomfield Track will greatly affect people like me.
17. I have no idea what the people in the Bloomfield area think about the Bloomfield Track.
18. The Bloomfield Track issue is important for Queensland.
19. The future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by everyone and not just by those who live in the Bloomfield area.
20. I don't know if improving the Bloomfield Track would lead to a rapid acceleration of development in the area to the detriment of the environment.
21. The fate of the Bloomfield Track is of no concern to me.
22. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track is permanently damaging the coral reefs that fringe the beaches below
23. The Wujal Wujal Community is better off now that the Bloomfield Track has been built.
24. Let's fix the problems in the Daintree just for now. The future will take care of itself.
25. I don't know what the people of Bloomfield think about the Bloomfield Track.
26. I don't like how development is creeping further and further North into the Daintree and beyond because of its effect on the environment.
27. I don't know how, but I think that there must be some way in which everybody benefits from protecting the rainforest near the Bloomfield Track.
28. If we don't take steps to protect the Daintree Rainforest future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the area as we do now.
29. If future generations could have their say about the Bloomfield track, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
30. The protection of plants and animals in the Daintree is OK so long as it doesn't affect me.
31. I don't really know who benefits most from the protection of Rainforest in the Daintree.
32. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Daintree region because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
33. Laying bitumen on the Bloomfield Track would be beneficial for the environment
34. The Bloomfield Track is important because it allows quick access to remote areas of the North.
35. The more that it is possible for the average North Queensland resident can access the Bloomfield Track the better
36. I think that both short and long term perspectives are needed in deciding what should be done with the Bloomfield Track, but I don't know which one is more important.
37. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track does not cause siltation or damage to the fringing inshore reefs between Cape Tribulation and Cooktown
38. Native animals in the Daintree need protection because they have a right to life which cannot be traded against economic considerations.
39. There is no reason to believe that the Daintree Rainforest is under threat.
40. Economic development associated with the Bloomfield Track will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
41. I'm concerned that I will be made worse off by any decision about the Bloomfield Track.
42. The most important use of the Bloomfield Track is for tourism.","1. 2

3. The Wujal Wujal Community is better off now that the Bloomfield Track has been built.
4. Conservation in the Daintree area is worthwhile at whatever cost.
5. Native animals in the Daintree need protection because they have a right to life which cannot be traded against economic considerations.

8. I'm not sure if the future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by locals, outsiders or both.
9. Whilst impacts on locals in the Bloomfield area are a concern, it is the broader community that should carry more weight when deciding what to do with the Bloomfield Track.

22. There is no reason to believe that the Daintree Rainforest is under threat.
23. I have no idea what the people in the Bloomfield area think about the Bloomfield Track.
24. If future generations could have their say about the Bloomfield track, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
25. I don't know how, but I think that there must be some way in which everybody benefits from protecting the rainforest near the Bloomfield Track.
26. If the Bloomfield Track is sealed (bitumenized) there will not be a rapid increase in environmentally damaging development in the Daintree area in the future It may even benefit the environment there.
27. The protection of plants and animals in the Daintree is OK so long as it doesn't affect me.
28. A long term perspective on the Bloomfield Track is essential.
29. Everyone in Queensland is better off for having a road like the Bloomfield Track.

37. Laying bitumen on the Bloomfield Track would be beneficial for the environment
38. Let's fix the problems in the Daintree just for now. The future will take care of itself.
39. I don't know if improving the Bloomfield Track would lead to a rapid acceleration of development in the area to the detriment of the environment.
40. The road is just the 'thin edge of the wedge'. This may not happen for a long time, but it will happen.
41. I don't know what the people of Bloomfield think about the Bloomfield Track.
42. In deciding on what to do with the Bloomfield Track I don't know whether it's more important to meet the needs of the community or the environment.","1. 10

## [Considerations]:
1. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
2. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
3. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
4. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
5. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
6. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
7. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
8. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
9. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
10. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
11. People get the government they deserve
12. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
13. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
14. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
15. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
16. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
17. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
18. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
19. I'm always cynical about government processes.
20. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
21. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
22. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
23. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
24. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
25. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
26. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
27. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
28. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
29. We live in a great democracy.
30. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
31. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
32. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
33. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
34. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
35. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
36. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
37. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
38. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
39. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
40. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
41. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
42. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
43. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
44. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
45. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
46. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
47. We are a democratic country.

1. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
2. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
3. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
4. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
5. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
6. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
7. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
8. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
9. We can adapt to the coming changes.
10. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
11. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
12. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
13. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
14. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
15. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
16. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
17. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
18. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
19. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
20. I care about the planet.
21. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
22. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
23. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
24. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
25. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
26. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
27. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
28. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
29. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
30. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
31. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
32. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
33. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.","1. 4

## [Considerations]:
1. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
2. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
3. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
4. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
5. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
6. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
7. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
8. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
9. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
10. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
11. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
12. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
13. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
14. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
15. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
16. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
17. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
18. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
19. Forest health means jobs.
20. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
21. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
22. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
23. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
24. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
25. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
26. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
27. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
28. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
29. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
30. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
31. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
32. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
33. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
34. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
35. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
36. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
37. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
38. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
39. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
40. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
41. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
42. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
43. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
44. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
45. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.","1. 8

5. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
6. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
7. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
8. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
9. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.

12. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
13. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
14. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.

13. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
14. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
15. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?

## [Considerations]:
1. The problem is not the vulnerable structure of the bridge but excessive traffic, which should be reduced.
2. Providing a better pedestrian and cycle traffic should be the main consideration when deciding about the future of the bridge.
3. We should definitely preserve the heritage value of the bridge, but only if it is financially viable.
4. The old bridge provides a scenic entrance to Fremantle that attracts tourists.
5. Indigenous people would want to minimize impact on the Swan River, a registered site, that is of importance and significance to them.
6. It is worth spending money to retain the iconic status of the bridge.
7. The critical infrastructure of the bridge raises serious safety concerns. 
8. Tax payers money should be spent on services that are more essential than upgrading the bridge.
9. The Fremantle Bridge is irreplaceable. It is a strong, enduring part of our history.
10. It is most important that the solution is a long term one.
11. Replacing timber elements with steel components would destroy the authentic appearance of the bridge.
12. Safe and efficient movement of all road and river users across and under the bridge should the main considerations
13. We just got traffic calming in Town Centre after 25 years effort. I don't want bridge to be build bigger, better faster to reverse the gains of the last 25 years.
14. When deciding about the future of the bridge, indigenous concerns should be given adequate consideration. 
15. The most important issue for cyclists is safety, which means they need access across the bridge which has a good surface.

13. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
14. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
15. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
16. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
17. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
18. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.

## [Considerations]:
1. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
2. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
3. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
4. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
5. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
6. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
7. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
8. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
9. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
10. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
11. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
12. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
13. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
14. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
15. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
16. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
17. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
18. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
19. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
20. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
21. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
22. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
23. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
24. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
25. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
26. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
27. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
28. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
29. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
30. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
31. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
32. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
33. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
34. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
35. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
36. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
37. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
38. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
39. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
40. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
41. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
42. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
43. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
2. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
3. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
4. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
5. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
6. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
7. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
8. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
9. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
10. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
11. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
12. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
13. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
14. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
15. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
16. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
17. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
18. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
19. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
20. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
21. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
22. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
23. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
24. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
25. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
26. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
27. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
28. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
29. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
30. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
31. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
32. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
33. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
34. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
35. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
36. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
37. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
38. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
39. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
40. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
41. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
42. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
43. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
2. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
3. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
4. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
5. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
6. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
7. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
8.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
9. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
10. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
11. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
12. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
13. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
14. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
15. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
16. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
17. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
18. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
19. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
20. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
21. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
22. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
23. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
24. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
25. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
26. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
27. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
28. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
29. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
30. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
31. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
32. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
33. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
34. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
35. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
36. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
37. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
38. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
39. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
40. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
41. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
42. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
43. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
44. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
45. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.","1. 4

1. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.
2. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.
3. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
4. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
5. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities
6. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process
7. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
8. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
9. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
10. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
11. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
12. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
13. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
14. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
15. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
16. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
17. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
18. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
19. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
20. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
21. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
22. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
23. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
24. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
25. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
26. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
27. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
28. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
29. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
30. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
31. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
32. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
33. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
34. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
35. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine

## [Considerations]:
1. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
2. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
3. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
4. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
5. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
6. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
7. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
8. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
9. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
10. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
11. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
12. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
13. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
14. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
15. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
16. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
17. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
18. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
19. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
20. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
21. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
22. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
23. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
24. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
25. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
26. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
27. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
28. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
29. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
30. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
31. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
32. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
33. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
34. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
35. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.","1. 2

1. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
2. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
3. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
4. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
5. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
6. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
7. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
8. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
9. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
10. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
11. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
12. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
13. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
14. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
15. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
16. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
17. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
18. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
19. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
20. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
21. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
22. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
23. Genome editing is really cool science.
24. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
25. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
26. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
27. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
28. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
29. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
30. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are.

2. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
3. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
4. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
5. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
6. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
7. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
8. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
9. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
10. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
11. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
12. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
13. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.

18. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
19. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
20. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
21. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
22. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.

## [Considerations]:
1. I don't know if improving the Bloomfield Track would lead to a rapid acceleration of development in the area to the detriment of the environment.
2. When it comes to the Bloomfield track, people living in Cairns are in no position to judge what the interests of the local residents of Bloomfield are.
3. Let's fix the problems in the Daintree just for now. The future will take care of itself.
4. The most important use of the Bloomfield Track is for tourism.
5. Everyone in Queensland is better off for having a road like the Bloomfield Track.
6. No development should be permitted in World Heritage areas such as the Daintree.
7. The Wujal Wujal Community is better off now that the Bloomfield Track has been built.
8. Erosion from the Bloomfield Track does not cause siltation or damage to the fringing inshore reefs between Cape Tribulation and Cooktown
9. Economic development associated with the Bloomfield Track will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
10. If future generations could have their say about the Bloomfield track, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
11. I would be worse off if more of the Daintree rainforest is protected.
12. The more that it is possible for the average North Queensland resident can access the Bloomfield Track the better
13. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Daintree region because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
14. I think that both short and long term perspectives are needed in deciding what should be done with the Bloomfield Track, but I don't know which one is more important.
15. I'm concerned that I will be made worse off by any decision about the Bloomfield Track.
16. The fate of the Bloomfield Track is of no concern to me.
17. The Bloomfield Track may not have been the best idea, but I guess there is probably little point in closing it now that it has been built.
18. I don't know how, but I think that there must be some way in which everybody benefits from protecting the rainforest near the Bloomfield Track.
19. Conservation in the Daintree area is worthwhile at whatever cost.
20. In deciding on what to do with the Bloomfield Track I don't know whether it's more important to meet the needs of the community or the environment.
21. I'm not sure if the future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by locals, outsiders or both.
22. When it comes to the Bloomfield Track, it's not important to worry about what the future will hold
23. Using cars on the Bloomfield Track is bad for the rainforest.
24. I don't know what the people of Bloomfield think about the Bloomfield Track.
25. I don't really know who benefits most from the protection of Rainforest in the Daintree.
26. The coral reefs along the foreshore below the Bloomfield Track are not badly affected by the road.
27. The protection of plants and animals in the Daintree is OK so long as it doesn't affect me.
28. A long term perspective on the Bloomfield Track is essential.
29. The Bloomfield Track issue is important for Queensland.

## [Considerations]:
1. We are a democratic country.
2. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
3. I'm always cynical about government processes.
4. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
5. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
6. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
7. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
8. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
9. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
10. We live in a great democracy.
11. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
12. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
13. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
14. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
15. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
16. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
17. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
18. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
19. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
20. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
21. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
22. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
23. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
24. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
25. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
26. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
27. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
28. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
29. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
30. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
31. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
32. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
33. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
34. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
35. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
36. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
37. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
38. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
39. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
40. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
41. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
42. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
43. People get the government they deserve
44. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
45. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
46. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
47. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
48. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.","1. 9

10. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
11. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
12. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
13. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
14. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
15. We are a democratic country.
16. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
17. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
18. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
19. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
20. People get the government they deserve
21. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
22. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
23. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
24. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
25. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
26. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
27. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
28. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
29. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
30. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
31. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
32. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
33. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
34. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
35. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
36. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
37. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
38. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
39. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
40. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
41. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
42. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
43. We live in a great democracy.
44. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
45. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
46. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
47. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
48. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.","1. 9

3. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
4. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
5. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
6. I'm always cynical about government processes.
7. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
8. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
9. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
10. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
11. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
12. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
13. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
14. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
15. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
16. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
17. People get the government they deserve
18. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
19. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
20. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
21. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
22. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
23. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
24. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
25. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
26. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
27. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
28. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
29. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
30. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
31. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
32. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
33. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
34. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
35. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
36. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
37. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
38. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
39. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
40. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
41. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
42. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
43. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
44. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
45. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
46. We live in a great democracy.
47. We are a democratic country.
48. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
2. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
3. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
4. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
5. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
6. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
7. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
8. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
9. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
10. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
11. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
12. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
13. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
14. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
15. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
16. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
17. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
18. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
19. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
20. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
21. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
22. People get the government they deserve
23. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
24. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
25. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
26. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
27. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
28. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
29. I'm always cynical about government processes.
30. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
31. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
32. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
33. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
34. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
35. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
36. We live in a great democracy.
37. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
38. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
39. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
40. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
41. We are a democratic country.
42. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
43. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
44. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
45. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
46. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
47. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
48. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
2. People get the government they deserve
3. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
4. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
5. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
6. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
7. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
8. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
9. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
10. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
11. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
12. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
13. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
14. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
15. We live in a great democracy.
16. I'm always cynical about government processes.
17. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
18. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
19. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
20. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
21. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
22. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
23. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
24. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
25. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
26. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
27. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
28. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
29. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
30. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
31. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
32. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
33. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
34. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
35. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
36. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
37. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
38. We are a democratic country.
39. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
40. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
41. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
42. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
43. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
44. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
45. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
46. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
47. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
48. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.","1. 9

## [Considerations]:
1. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
2. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
3. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
4. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
5. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
6. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
7. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
8. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
9. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
10. I'm always cynical about government processes.
11. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
12. We live in a great democracy.
13. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
14. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
15. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
16. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
17. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
18. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
19. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
20. People get the government they deserve
21. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
22. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
23. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
24. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
25. We are a democratic country.
26. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
27. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
28. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
29. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
30. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
31. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
32. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
33. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
34. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
35. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
36. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
37. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
38. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
39. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
40. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
41. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
42. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
43. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
44. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
45. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
46. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
47. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
48. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.","1. 8

19. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
20. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
21. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.

23. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
24. I'm always cynical about government processes.

27. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
28. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
29. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
30. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
31. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
32. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
33. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
34. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
35. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
36. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
37. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
38. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
39. We live in a great democracy.
40. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
41. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
42. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
43. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
44. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
45. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
46. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
47. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.

1. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
2. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
3. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
4. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
5. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
6. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
7. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
8. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
9. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
10. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
11. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
12. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
13. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
14. We can adapt to the coming changes.
15. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
16. I care about the planet.
17. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
18. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
19. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
20. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
21. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
22. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
23. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
24. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
25. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
26. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
27. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
28. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.

## [Considerations]:
1. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
2. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
3. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
4. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
5. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
6. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
7. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
8. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
9. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
10. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
11. I care about the planet.
12. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
13. We can adapt to the coming changes.
14. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
15. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
16. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
17. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
18. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
19. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
20. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
21. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
22. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
23. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
24. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
25. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
26. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
27. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
28. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
29. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
30. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
31. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
32. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.

1. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
2. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
3. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
4. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
5. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
6. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
7. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
8. We can adapt to the coming changes.
9. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
10. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
11. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
12. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
13. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
14. I care about the planet.
15. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
16. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
17. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
18. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
19. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
20. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
21. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
22. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
23. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
24. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
25. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
26. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
27. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
28. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
29. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
30. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
31. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.

## [Considerations]:
1. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
2. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
3. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
4. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
5. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
6. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
7. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
8. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
9. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
10. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
11. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
12. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
13. Forest health means jobs.
14. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
15. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
16. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
17. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
18. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
19. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
20. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
21. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
22. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
23. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
24. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
25. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
26. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
27. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
28. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
29. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
30. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
31. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
32. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
33. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
34. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
35. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
36. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
37. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
38. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
39. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
40. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
41. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
42. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
43. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
44. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
45. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.","1. 9

2. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
3. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
4. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
5. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
6. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
7. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
8. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
9. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
10. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
11. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
12. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
13. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
14. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
15. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
16. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
17. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
18. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
19. Forest health means jobs.
20. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
21. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
22. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
23. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
24. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
25. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
26. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
27. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
28. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
29. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
30. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
31. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
32. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
33. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
34. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
35. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
36. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
37. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
38. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
39. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
40. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
41. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
42. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
43. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
44. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
45. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
2. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
3. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
4. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
5. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
6. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
7. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
8. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
9. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
10. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
11. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
12. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
13. Forest health means jobs.
14. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
15. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
16. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
17. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
18. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
19. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
20. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
21. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
22. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
23. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
24. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
25. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
26. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
27. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
28. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
29. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
30. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
31. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
32. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
33. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
34. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
35. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
36. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
37. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
38. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
39. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
40. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
41. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
42. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
43. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
44. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
45. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.","1. 8

38. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
39. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
40. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
41. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
42. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
43. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.

1. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
2. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
3. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
4. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
5. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
6. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
7. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
8. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
9. Forest health means jobs.
10. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
11. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
12. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
13. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
14. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
15. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
16. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
17. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
18. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
19. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
20. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
21. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
22. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
23. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
24. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
25. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
26. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
27. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
28. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
29. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
30. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
31. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
32. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
33. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
34. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
35. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
36. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
37. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
38. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
39. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
40. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
41. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
42. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
43. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
44. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.

## [Considerations]:
1. Forest health means jobs.
2. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
3. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
4. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
5. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
6. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
7. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
8. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
9. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
10. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
11. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
12. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
13. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
14. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
15. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
16. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
17. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
18. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
19. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
20. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
21. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
22. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
23. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
24. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
25. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
26. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
27. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
28. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
29. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
30. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
31. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
32. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
33. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
34. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
35. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
36. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
37. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
38. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
39. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
40. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
41. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
42. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
43. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
44. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
45. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. ","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
2. We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
3. If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species.
4. To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees.
5. Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
6. We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
7. We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
8. Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
9. Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
10. Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
11. Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
12. Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
13. People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. 
14. We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels.
15. Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
16. Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
17. The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
18. Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry.
19. Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation.
20. Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations.
21. Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
22. The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
23. Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
24. Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
25. Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
26. Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
27. Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
28. Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas.
29. All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
30. Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
31. Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration.
32. Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
33. Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
34. Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies.
35. The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
36. A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
37. Forest health means jobs.
38. We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we're going to make mistakes.
39. Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation.
40. Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock.
41. We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
42. Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
43. Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
44. Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
45. Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.","1. 9

1. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for bothers me. 
2. Participants who donate their samples for research should be given special access to the treatments and therapies that result from that research. 
3. Genetic information is different from health information. 
4. I trust researchers to control access to my personal samples.
5. Scientists should have access to all unidentified, personal samples for research.
6. If someone is a carrier of a genetic disease, they have a responsibility to participate in genetic research.
7. Biobanks need independent review boards to determine who should have access to samples. 
8. The priority for healthcare should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
9. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government. 
10. Genetic studies of disability will lead to the discrimination of people living with the same conditions.
11. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies.
12. Profits from biobanking should be returned to the donating community. 
13. Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.
14. To me, religious communities need to be consulted about genetic and biobank research. 
15. There is no point in consulting the public about ethical issues in science and technology.
16. The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  
17. I do not care if my donated sample is connected to my name and medical information.
18. I should have property rights to my tissues before or after they leave my body.
19. Participants should be contacted every time researchers want to use their samples for research.
20. Biobanks will only lead to expensive treatments and high profits. 
21. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
22. Aboriginal communities require special consideration concerning healthcare and research.
23. There is no risk to the participants who donate to biobanks.
24. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.  
25. All participants should be paid for donating their samples to a biobank. 
26. Educating people about health issues (e.g. diet and lifestyle changes) promises greater health effects than investing in biobanks.
27. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
28. Researchers should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.  
29. Genetic research will improve our lives.
30. It is always permissible to do research on my personally identifiable sample without my prior permission.  
31. Policy makers should consider the possibility that Canada should not pursue biobanking.
32. Genetic studies of race on enthocultural communities will lead to the discrimination of those same enthocultural communities. 
33. Participants should be active in the set up and oversight of  biobanks. 
34. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health.
35. My personal sample should never be anonymized since I should be informed of important research results.  
36. Sampling some people in an ethnocultural community is acceptable only if the whole ethnocultural community has agreed to participate.
37. Participants should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at anytime. 
38. Everyone should donate samples to a biobank for the benefit of everyone. ","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government. 
2. I do not care if my donated sample is connected to my name and medical information.
3. Participants who donate their samples for research should be given special access to the treatments and therapies that result from that research. 
4. My personal sample should never be anonymized since I should be informed of important research results.  
5. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.  
6. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
7. Researchers should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.  
8. If someone is a carrier of a genetic disease, they have a responsibility to participate in genetic research.
9. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for bothers me. 
10. Everyone should donate samples to a biobank for the benefit of everyone. 
11. There is no point in consulting the public about ethical issues in science and technology.
12. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies.
13. Genetic studies of disability will lead to the discrimination of people living with the same conditions.
14. Profits from biobanking should be returned to the donating community. 
15. I should have property rights to my tissues before or after they leave my body.
16. Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.
17. It is always permissible to do research on my personally identifiable sample without my prior permission.  
18. Participants should be active in the set up and oversight of  biobanks. 
19. All participants should be paid for donating their samples to a biobank. 
20. Participants should be contacted every time researchers want to use their samples for research.
21. Genetic research will improve our lives.
22. Participants should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at anytime. 
23. Biobanks need independent review boards to determine who should have access to samples. 
24. The priority for healthcare should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
25. Genetic studies of race on enthocultural communities will lead to the discrimination of those same enthocultural communities. 
26. Biobanks will only lead to expensive treatments and high profits. 
27. There is no risk to the participants who donate to biobanks.
28. Scientists should have access to all unidentified, personal samples for research.
29. The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  
30. I trust researchers to control access to my personal samples.
31. To me, religious communities need to be consulted about genetic and biobank research. 
32. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
33. Sampling some people in an ethnocultural community is acceptable only if the whole ethnocultural community has agreed to participate.
34. Aboriginal communities require special consideration concerning healthcare and research.
35. Educating people about health issues (e.g. diet and lifestyle changes) promises greater health effects than investing in biobanks.
36. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health.
37. Genetic information is different from health information. 
38. Policy makers should consider the possibility that Canada should not pursue biobanking.","1. 8

7. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
8. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.

12. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
13. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
14. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
15. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.

17. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
18. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
19. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
20. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
21. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
22. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.

26. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
27. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
28. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
29. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.

7. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
8. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
9. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
10. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
11. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
12. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
13. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
14. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
15. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
16. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
17. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
18. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
19. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
20. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
21. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
22. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
23. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.

1. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
2. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
3. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
4. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
5. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
6. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
7. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
8. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
9. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
10. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
11. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
12. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
13. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
14. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
15. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
16. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
17. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
18. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
19. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
20. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
21. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
22. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
23. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
24. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
25. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
26. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue.

2. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
3. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
4. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
5. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
6. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
7. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
8. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
9. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
10. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
11. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
12. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
13. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
14. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
15. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
16. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
17. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
18. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
19. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
20. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
21. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
22. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
23. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
24. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
25. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
26. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
27. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
28. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
29. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
30. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
31. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.","1. 6

5. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
6. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
7. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
8. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
9. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
10. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
11. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
12. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
13. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
14. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
15. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
16. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
17. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
18. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
19. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.

1. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
2. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
3. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
4. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
5. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
6. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
7. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
8. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
9. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
10. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
11. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
12. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
13. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
14. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
15. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
16. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
17. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
18. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
19. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
20. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
21. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
22. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
23. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
24. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
25. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
26. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding.

## [Considerations]:
1. Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
2. We need (local) funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding.
3. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
4. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
5. The climate threat to the Alpine glaciers is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
6. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
7. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
8. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
9. Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
10. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
11. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures.
12. Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change.
13. We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather.
14. The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
15. We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
16. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
17. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
18. It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
19. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
20. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
21. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
22. Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. 
23. Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops).
24. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
25. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
26. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
27. The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
28. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference.
29. Occorre tenere conto degli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico sul commercio locale.
30. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
31. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.","1. 7

1. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
2. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
3. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
4. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
5. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
6. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
7. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
8. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
9. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
10. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
11. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
12. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
13. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
14. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
15. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
16. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
17. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
18. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
19. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
20. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
21. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
22. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
23. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
24. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
25. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
26. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
27. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
28. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
29. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.

6. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
7. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
8. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
9. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
10. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
11. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
12. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
13. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
14. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
15. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
16. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
17. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
18. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
2. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
3. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
4. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
5. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
6. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
7. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
8. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
9. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
10. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
11. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
12. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
13. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
14. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
15. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
16. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
17. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
18. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
19. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
20. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
21. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
22. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
23. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
24. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
25. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
26. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
27. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
28. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
29. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.

2. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
3. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
4. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern.
5. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
6. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
7. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
8. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
9. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
10. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
11. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
12. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
13. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
14. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
15. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
16. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
17. Communities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
18. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
19. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
20. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
21. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.

23. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
24. Climate variability is normal, so why should this be a problem?
25. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
26. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
27. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
28. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.

## [Considerations]:
1. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
2. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
3. Food waste is a major environmental issue
4. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
5. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
6. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
7. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
8. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
9. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
10. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
11. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
12. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
13. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
14. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
15. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
16. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
17. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
18. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
19. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
20. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
21. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
22. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
23. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
24. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
25. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
26. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
27. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
28. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
29. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture

## [Considerations]:
1. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
2. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
3. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
4. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
5. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
6. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
7. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
8. Food waste is a major environmental issue
9. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
10. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
11. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
12. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
13. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
14. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
15. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
16. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
17. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
18. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
19. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
20. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
21. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
22. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
23. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
24. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
25. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
26. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
27. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
28. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
29. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
30. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
2. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
3. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
4. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
5. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
6. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
7. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
8. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
9. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
10. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
11. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
12. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
13. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
14. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
15. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
16. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
17. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
18. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
19. Food waste is a major environmental issue
20. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
21. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
22. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
23. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
24. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
25. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
26. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
27. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
28. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.

1. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
2. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
3. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
4. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
5. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
6. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
7. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
8. Food waste is a major environmental issue
9. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
10. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
11. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
12. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
13. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
14. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
15. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
16. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
17. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
18. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
19. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
20. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
21. Restaurants in schools or retirement homes should only offer vegetarian menus.
22. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
23. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
24. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
25. Animal antibiotical resistance will be the source of the next global pandemic
26. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
27. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
28. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
29. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices

2. Intensive animal farming and monocultural plantation guarantees food supply
3. We should introduce taxes to prevent food waste
4. Strong regulation of food products will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
5. Subsidies should only be given to farmers that do not use pesticides or antibiotics
6. Food waste is an important social issue (e.g. hunger in the world)
7. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
8. Food thrown away is natural and biodegradable and thus not an issue for the environment
9. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
10. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
11. Food waste is a major environmental issue
12. Products that employ products that damage the environment, such as palm oil, should be taxed in a similar fashion to tobacco products
13. Food that is NOT environmentally-sustainable, healthy and fairly-produced should be clearly labelled
14. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
15. Farmers should be encouraged to practice ecologically sustainable agriculture, such as permaculture.
16. I am happy to change my nutrition habits, as use leftovers in future meals, if this helps to prevent food waste
17. Biodiversity is at risk due to the use of pesticides and monoculture farming
18. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
19. I am happy to buy fairtrade products, like chocolate or coffee, even if they are of lower quality
20. Extreme weather disasters affect global food availability
21. The government should ensure that farmers are paid fair prices for their produce to secure higher incomes for those working in agriculture
22. I don't care where the product I am buying comes from.
23. Switzerland already has some of the toughest regulations about protecting our environment and agriculture
24. The government should apply costum duties on imported products that can be produced in Switzerland (e.g., cheese, honey, apples, beef)
25. If Switzerland implements strong regulations on importing environmentally-sustainable and fairly-produced food, we would either have to step out of our international trade agreements or have to renegotiate most of them
26. In Switzerland, packaging waste is a greater environmental issue than food thrown away
27. It is essential to always have fresh products available to be prepared for any situation (e.g. unexpected guests)
28. To give subsidies only to farmers who do not use pesticides is an ""extreme"" approach that would mean falling crop yields and higher food prices
29. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?

10. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
11. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
12. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
13. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
14. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
15. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
16. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
17. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.

19. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
20. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
21. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
2. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
3. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
4. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
5. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
6. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
7. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
8. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
9. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
10. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
11. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
12. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
13. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
14. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
15. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
16. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
17. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
18. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
19. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
20. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
21. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
22. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
23. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
24. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
25. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
26. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
27. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
28. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
29. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
30. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
31. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.

## [Considerations]:
1. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
2. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
3. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
4. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
5. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
6. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
7. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
8. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
9. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
10. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
11. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
12. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
13. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
14. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
15. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
16. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
17. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its CO₂ emissions, global warming would continue.
18. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
19. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
20. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
21. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
22. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
23. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
24. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
25. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
26. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
27. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
28. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
29. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
30. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
31. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.

## [Considerations]:
1. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
2. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.
3. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
4. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.
5. It is certain to say that climate change exists.
6. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
7. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
8. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
9. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
10. Climate change is natural; there is no need to worry.
11. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
12. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
13. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.
14. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
15. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
16. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
17. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
18. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
19. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.
20. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
21. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
22. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
23. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
24. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
25. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
26. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
27. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
28. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.
29. Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
30. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.

1. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
2. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
3. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
4. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
5. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
6. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
7. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
8. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
9. It is certain that climate change exists.
10. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
11. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
12. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
13. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
14. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
15. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
16. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
17. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
18. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
19. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
20. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
21. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
22. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
23. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
24. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
25. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
26. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
27. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
28. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
29. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.

1. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
2. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
3. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
4. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
5. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
6. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
7. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
8. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
9. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
10. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
11. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
12. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
13. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
14. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
15. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
16. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
17. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.
18. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
19. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
20. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
21. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
22. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
23. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
24. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
25. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
26. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
27. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.
28. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
29. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
30. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
31. It is certain that climate change exists.

## [Considerations]:
1. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.
2. Municipalities have sufficient resources to effectively adapt to climate change.
3. The climate threat to alpine glaciers is too distant from local issues to be of concern in the Canton Aargau.
4. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).
5. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.
6. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.
7. Further (local) funding is needed to strengthen our emergency response to events such as floods.
8. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.
9. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.
10. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.
11. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.
12. If Switzerland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions, it won't make any difference.
13. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.
14. Biodiversity is declining worldwide.
15. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.
16. It is certain that climate change exists.
17. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change.
18. Climate change adaptation planning requires a holistic approach that considers a wide range of areas rather than focusing on individual issues.
19. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.
20. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.
21. Some groups will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not a priority issue.
22. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.
23. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.
24. The main goal of climate change adaptation planning should be preparing for extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
25. Climate change is mainly caused by human activities.
26. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.
27. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.
28. Climate fluctuations are normal and do not pose a problem for humans.
29. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.
30. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.
31. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.
32. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
2. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
3. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
4. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
5. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
6. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
7. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
8. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
9. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
10. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
11. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
12. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
13. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
14. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
15. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
16. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
17. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
18. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
19. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
20. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.","1. 1

1. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
2. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
3. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
4. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
5. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.
6. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
7. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
8. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
9. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
10. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
11. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
12. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
13. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
14. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
15. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
16. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
17. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
18. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
19. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.

## [Considerations]:
1. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
2. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
3. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
4. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
5. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
6. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
7. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
8. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
9. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
10. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
11. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
12. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
13. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
14. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
15. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
16. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
17. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
18. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
19. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
20. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
21. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
22. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
23. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
24. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
25. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
26. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
27. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
28. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
29. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
30. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
31. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
32. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
33. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
34. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
35. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
36. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
37. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
38. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
39. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
40. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
41. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
42. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues.

## [Considerations]:
1. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
2. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
3. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
4. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
5. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
6. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
7. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
8. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
9. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
10. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
11. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
12. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
13. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
14. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
15. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
16. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
17. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
18. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
19. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
20. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
21. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
22. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
23. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
24. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
25. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
26. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
27. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
28. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
29. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
30. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
31. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
32. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
33. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
34. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
35. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
36. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
37. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
38. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
39. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
40. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
41. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
42. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
43. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. ","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
2. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
3. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
4. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
5. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
6. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
7. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
8. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
9. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
10. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
11. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
12. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
13. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
14. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
15. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
16. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
17. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
18. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
19. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
20. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
21. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
22. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
23. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
24. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
25. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
26. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
27. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
28. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
29. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
30. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
31. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
32. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
33. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
34. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
35. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
36. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
37. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
38. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
39. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
40. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
41. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
42. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.

## [Considerations]:
1. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
2. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
3. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.

5. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
6. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
7. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
8. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
9. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
10. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.

15. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
16. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
17. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
18. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
19. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
20. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
21. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
22. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
23. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
24. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
25. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
26. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.

## [Considerations]:
1. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
2. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
3. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
4. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
5. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
6. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
7. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
8. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
9. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
10. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
11. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
12. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
13. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
14. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
15. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
16. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
17. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
18. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
19. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
20. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
21. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
22. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
23. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
24. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
25. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
26. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
27. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
28. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
29. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
30. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
31. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
32. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
33. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
34. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
35. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
36. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
37. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
38. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
39. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
40. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
41. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
42. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding.

5. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
6. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
7. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
8. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
9. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
10. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
11. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
12. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.

14. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
15. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
16. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
17. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
18. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
19. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
20. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
21. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
22. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
23. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
24. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
25. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
26. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
27. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
28. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”

31. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
32. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
33. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
34. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.

## [Considerations]:
1. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
2. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
3. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
4. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
5. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
6. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
7. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
8. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
9. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
10. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
11. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
12. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
13. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
14. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
15. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
16. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
17. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
18. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
19. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
20. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
21. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
22. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
23. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
24. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
25. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
26. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
27. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
28. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
29. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
30. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
31. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
32. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
33. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
34. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
35. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
36. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
37. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
38. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
39. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
40. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
41. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
42. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
43. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
2.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
3. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
4. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
5. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
6. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
7. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
8. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
9. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
10. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
11. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
12. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
13. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
14. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
15. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
16. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
17. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
18. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.

41. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
42. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).

1. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
2. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
3. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
4. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
5. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies.

10. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
11. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
12. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
13.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
14. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
15. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
16. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
17. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.

27. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
28. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
29. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
30. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
31. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.

## [Considerations]:
1. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
2. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities
3. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
4. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
5. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.
6. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
7. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
8. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
9. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.
10. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
11. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
12. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
13. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.
14. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
15. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.
16. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
17. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
18. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
19. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
20. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
21. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
22. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
23. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.
24. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
25. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process
26. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
27. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.
28. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
29. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""
30. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money
31. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
32. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
33. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
34. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
35. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
36. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
2. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
3. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
4. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
5. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
6. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
7. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
8. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
9. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
10. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
11. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
12. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
13. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
14. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
15. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
16. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
17. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
18. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
19. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
20. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
21. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
22. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
23. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
24. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.","1. 5

## [Considerations]:
1. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
2. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
3. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
4. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
5. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
6. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
7. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
8. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
9. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
10. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
11. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
12. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
13. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
14. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
15. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
16. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
17. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
18. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
19. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
20. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
21. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
22. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
23. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.

## [Considerations]:
1. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
2. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
3. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
4. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
5. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
6. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
7. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
8. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
9. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
10. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
11. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
12. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
13. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
14. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
15. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
16. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
17. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
18. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
19. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
20. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
21. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
22. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
23. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.

## [Considerations]:
1. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
2. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
3. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
4. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
5. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
6. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
7. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
8. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
9. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
10. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
11. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
12. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
13. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
14. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
15. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
16. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
17. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
18. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
19. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
20. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
21. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
22. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.

## [Considerations]:
1. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
2. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
3. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
4. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
5. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
6. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
7. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
8. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
9. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
10. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
11. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
12. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
13. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
14. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
15. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
16. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
17. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
18. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.

## [Considerations]:
1. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
2. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
3. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
4. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
5. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
6. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
7. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
8. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
9. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
10. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
11. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
12. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
13. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
14. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
15. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
16. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
17. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
18. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
19. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
20. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.

## [Considerations]:
1. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
2. Hospitals are more interested in maximizing their profits than in ensuring quality and access to healthcare.
3. More competition among insurance providers would lead to lower prices and better services.
4. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
5. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
6. More competition in mandatory health insurance, where insurers can offer alternative models, would promote innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
7. A public single-payer health insurance system would reduce administrative and marketing costs, making the healthcare system more affordable overall.
8. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
9. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.
10. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
11. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
12. Better coordination between primary care, hospitals, and specialists is essential for the effective treatment of chronic diseases.
13. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
14. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
15. The increasing demand for healthcare services is mainly due to an aging population that requires more medical care.
16. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
17. Income-based health insurance contributions would make insurance fairer for low-income individuals.
18. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
19. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
20. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
21. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
22. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
23. Higher out-of-pocket payments would prevent excessive use of healthcare services.
24. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.","1. 6

## [Considerations]:
1. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
2. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
3. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
4. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
5. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
6. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
7. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
8. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
9. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
10. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
11. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
12. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
13. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
14. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
15. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
16. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
17. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
18. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
19. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
20. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
21. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
22. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
23. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
24. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
25. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
26. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
27. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
28. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
29. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
30. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
31. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
32. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
33. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
34. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
35. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
36. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
37. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
38. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
39. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
40. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
41. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
42. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
43. Genetic research will improve our lives.
44. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
45. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
46. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
47. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
48. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.

1. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
2. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
3. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
4. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
5. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
6. Genetic research will improve our lives.
7. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
8. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
9. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
10. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
11. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
12. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
13. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
14. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
15. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
16. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
17. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
18. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
19. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
20. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
21. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
22. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
23. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
24. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
25. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
26. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
27. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
28. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
29. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
30. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
31. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
32. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
33. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
34. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
35. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
36. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
37. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
38. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
39. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
40. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
41. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
42. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
43. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body

## [Considerations]:
1. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
2. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
3. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
4. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
5. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
6. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
7. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
8. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
9. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
10. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
11. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
12. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
13. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
14. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
15. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
16. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
17. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
18. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
19. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
20. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
21. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
22. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
23. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
24. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
25. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
26. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
27. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
28. Genetic research will improve our lives.
29. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
30. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
31. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
32. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
33. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
34. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
35. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
36. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
37. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
38. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
39. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
40. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
41. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
42. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
43. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
44. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
45. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
46. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
47. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
48. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body

## [Considerations]:
1. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
2. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
3. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
4. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
5. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
6. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
7. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
8. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
9. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
10. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
11. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
12. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
13. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
14. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
15. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
16. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
17. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
18. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
19. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
20. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
21. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
22. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.
23. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
24. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
25. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
26. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
27. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
28. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
29. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
30. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
31. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
32. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
33. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
34. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
35. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
36. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
37. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
38. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
39. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
40. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
41. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
42. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
43. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
44. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
45. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
46. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
47. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
48. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research

## [Considerations]:
1. People should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at any time.
2. There must be special consideration of the views of Aboriginal people towards healthcare and genetic research.
3. People should be paid for providing their samples to a biobank.
4. I should have property rights to my tissues before and after they leave my body
5. The public will be more protected if biobanks are government-funded not privately funded.
6. Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
7. The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for in the future bothers me.
8. I do not mind if researchers have access to my samples, when there is no way I can be identified.
9. Collecting samples from people in an ethnic or cultural group is acceptable only if the whole group has agreed to participate.
10. High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health in other ways.
11. Genetic studies of race on ethnic or cultural groups will lead to the discrimination of those groups.
12. Genetic studies will lead to the discrimination of people living with genetic conditions or disabilities.
13. I trust independent research ethics committees, which are not connected to the biobank in anyway, to decide whether research is ethical and approve who gets access to my samples.
14. Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government.
15. The biobank owner should be able to sell any information they have about my genes, if they want to.
16. Biobanks will only lead to high profits and expensive treatments that most people can't afford.
17. The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
18. Improved health is more likely to come from educating people about their diet and lifestyle than from biobanks.
19. I should be asked for my permission every time researchers want to use my samples for research
20. Commercial companies should get access to biobanks, otherwise new drugs and treatments will not be developed.
21. Researchers and institutions (e.g. hospitals and universities) should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.
22. It is acceptable for samples and information that doesn't identify me to be sent to researchers overseas.
23. Genetic research will improve our lives.
24. Information about people's genes and the traits they inherit from their parents is more private than their medical records.
25. I trust biobanks with managers who are independent of researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
26. There is no point asking the public for their views on the ethical issues in science and technology.
27. My sample should never be permanently anonymized since I should be contacted about important research results
28. Biobanks are valuable even if they only advance science (e.g. provide new information about diseases) and do not lead to treatments or cures.
29. It is always acceptable to do research on samples that identify me, without my prior permission.
30. The priorities for health should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
31. Profits from biobanking should be shared in some way with the community who provided the samples.
32. Biobanks are valuable because they promise huge benefits for our economy.
33. I trust researchers to make sure only approved people get access to my samples
34. People who provide samples for research should get special access to the treatments that result from this research.
35. The community that provides samples for research should receive improved medical services in return.
36. People who provide samples should be active in the set up and ongoing management of biobanks.
37. Race is a useful topic for genetic studies
38. I do not mind if my sample is connected to my name and medical information.
39. People with a [chronic disease or] genetic condition in their family have a responsibility to be involved in genetic research.
40. Religious groups need to be asked for their views about biobanks and genetic research.
41. People should be told if commercial companies could get access to their samples and information.
42. We should all provide samples to biobanks because it will benefit everyone.
43. Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.
44. Biobanks need to be monitored and reviewed by external, independent people to prevent the misuse of data and samples.
45. I don't mind if my samples are connected to my medical records without my prior permission, so long as researchers don't get access to any data that identifies me.
46. Commercial companies should keep all the profits they make from biobanking because they take the financial risks and put up the money to develop new drugs and treatments.
47. It's OK if data that identifies me is stored in a separate database and replaced in the biobank by a unique non-identifying code.
48. Policy makers need to consider whether WA should not have biobanks.
49. There is no risk to the people who provide samples and information to biobanks.","1. 11

## [Considerations]:
1. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
2. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
3. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
4. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
5. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
6. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
7. Genome editing is really cool science.
8. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
9. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
10. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
11. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
12. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
13. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
14. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
15. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
16. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
17. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
18. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
19. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
20. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
21. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
22. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
23. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
24. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
25. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
26. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
27. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
28. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
29. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
30. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
31. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
32. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
33. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
34. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
35. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
36. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
37. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
38. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
39. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
40. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
41. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
42. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
43. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.

## [Considerations]:
1. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
2. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
3. Genome editing is really cool science.
4. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
5. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
6. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
7. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
8. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
9. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
10. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
11. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
12. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
13. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
14. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
15. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
16. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
17. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
18. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
19. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
20. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
21. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
22. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
23. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
24. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
25. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
26. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
27. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
28. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
29. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
30. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
31. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
32. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
33. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
34. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
35. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
36. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
37. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
38. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
39. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
40. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
41. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
42. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
43. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
44. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.

## [Considerations]:
1. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
2. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
3. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
4. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
5. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
6. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
7. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
8. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
9. The idea that genome editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
10. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
11. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
12. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
13. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
14. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
15. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
16. Genome editing is really cool science.
17. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
18. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
19. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
20. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
21. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
22. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
23. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
24. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
25. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
26. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
27. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
28. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
29. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
30. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
31. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
32. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
33. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
34. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
35. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
36. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
37. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
38. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
39. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
40. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
41. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
42. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
43. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.

3. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
4. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
5. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
6. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
7. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
8. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.

12. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
13. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
14. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
15. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
16. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
17. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.

23. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
24. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
25. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
26. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
27. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.

## [Considerations]:
1. If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
2. I have a more positive feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants.
3. Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
4. Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
5. Science and technology have too much control over our lives.
6. I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
7. We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are. 
8. Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing, as long as the changes cannot be passed on to future generations.
9. There is nothing wrong with using genome editing to speed up evolution and help living things (including humans) adapt to challenges.
10. I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
11. I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
12. If human genome editing is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it.
13. The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible.
14. Beacause of our changing environments, I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
15. I worry that something will go wrong with genome technology.
16. Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
17. The idea of editing the human genome is scary.
18. The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
19. If human genome editing can be used to make changes to humans on demand for any reason, the future will be like a dystopian movie.
20. I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
21. If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it.
22. I'm concerned that genome editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
23. Suggesting genome editing will 'cure' disability diminishes those living with genetic conditions who need support.
24. Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
25. It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don't understand.
26. When you change someone's genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
27. Genome editing will be used for enhancement by wealthy people.
28. Anything that's been artificially created in a lab gives me Frankenstein vibes.
29. I would consider using genome editing for my children to give them an advantage in life, so long as it's safe.
30. My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
31. It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
32. Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
33. I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
34. I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
35. Parents want 'designer babies' with certain traits out of vanity.
36. Genome editing technologies gives us power over human life itself.
37. I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
38. Mitochondrial donation is a treatment more like an organ transplant, which doesn't really change the genetics of person.
39. I'm worried that human genome editing will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't.
40. It's better to use genome editing to prevent a serious disease from happening rather than having to treat it with conventional medicine after it has occurred.
41. I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
42. As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases.
43. My concern is that as we start to tinker with the human genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems.
44. Genome editing is really cool science.

3. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
4. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
5. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
6. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
7. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
8. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
9. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
10. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
11. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
12. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
13. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
14. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
15. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
16. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
17. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
18. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
19. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
20. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
21. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.

23. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
24. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
25. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
26. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
27. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
28. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
29. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
30. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
31. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
32. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
33. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.

## [Considerations]:
1. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
2. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
3. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
4. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
5. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
6. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
7. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
8. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
9. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
10. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
11. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
12. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
13. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
14. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
15. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
16. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
17. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
18. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
19. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
20. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
21. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
22. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
23. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
24. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
25. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
26. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
27. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
28. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
29. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
30. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
31. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
32. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
33. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
34. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals.

## [Considerations]:
1. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
2. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
3. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
4. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
5. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
6. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
7. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
8. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
9. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
10. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
11. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
12. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
13. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
14. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
15. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
16. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
17. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
18. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
19. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
20. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
21. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
22. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
23. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
24. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
25. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
26. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
27. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
28. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
29. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
30. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
31. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
32. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
33. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
34. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
35. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.","1. 1

## [Considerations]:
1. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
2. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
3. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
4. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
5. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
6. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
7. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
8. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
9. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
10. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
11. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
12. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
13. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
14. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
15. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
16. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
17. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
18. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
19. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
20. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
21. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
22. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
23. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
24. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
25. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
26. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
27. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
28. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
29. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
30. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
31. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
32. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
33. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
34. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
35. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
2. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
3. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
4. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
5. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
6. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
7. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
8. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
9. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
10. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
11. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
12. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
13. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
14. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
15. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
16. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
17. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
18. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
19. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
20. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
21. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
22. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
23. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
24. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
25. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
26. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
27. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
28. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
29. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
30. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
31. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
32. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
33. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
34. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.

## [Considerations]:
1. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
2. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
3. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
4. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
5. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
6. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
7. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
8. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
9. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
10. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
11. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
12. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
13. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
14. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
15. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
16. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
17. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
18. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
19. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
20. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
21. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
22. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
23. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
24. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
25. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
26. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
27. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
28. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
29. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
30. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
31. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
32. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
33. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
34. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
35. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.","1. 1

## [Considerations]:
1. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
2. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
3. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
4. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
5. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
6. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
7. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
8. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
9. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
10. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
11. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
12. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
13. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
14. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
15. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
16. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
17. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
18. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
19. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
20. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
21. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
22. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
23. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
24. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
25. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
26. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
27. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
28. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
29. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
30. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
31. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
32. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
33. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
34. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.

## [Considerations]:
1. We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
2. Townsville is better off because of mining development.
3. Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef.
4. Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
5. There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
6. Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
7. Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
8. If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports.
9. While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. 
10. It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
11. Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
12. Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
13. The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
14. Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
15. I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
16. Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern.
17. More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
18. If we don't take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
19. Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
20. A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
21. We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy.
22. The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
23. Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
24. We don't need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
25. Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
26. If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out.
27. The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
28. The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
29. Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
30. The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
31. Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef.
32. Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine.
33. There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
34. There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
35. I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.","1. 2

1. the fusion is a leap in the unknown
2. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens

13. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
14. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
15. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.
16. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.

24. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.
25. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.
26. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
27. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.

## [Considerations]:
1. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
2. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
3. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
4. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
5. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
6. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
7. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
8. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
9. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
10. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
11. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
12. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
13. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
14. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
15. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
16. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
17. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
18. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
19. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
20. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
21. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
22. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
23. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
24. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
25.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
26. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
27. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
28. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
29. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
30. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
31. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
32. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
33. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
34. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
35. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
36. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
37. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
38. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
39. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
40. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
41. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
42. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
43. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
44. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
45. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.","1. 8

40. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
41. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
42. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
43. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
44. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.

## [Considerations]:
1. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
2. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
3. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
4. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
5. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
6. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
7. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
8. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
9. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
10. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
11. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
12. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
13. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
14. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
15. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
16. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
17. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
18. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
19. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
20.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
21. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
22. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
23. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
24. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
25. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
26. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
27. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
28. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
29. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
30. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
31. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
32. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
33. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
34. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
35. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
36. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
37. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
38. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
39. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
40. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
41. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
42. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
43. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
44. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
45. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.","1. 4

## [Considerations]:
1. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
2. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
3. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
4. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
5. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
6. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
7. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
8. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
9. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
10. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
11. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
12. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
13. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
14. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
15. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
16. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
17. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
18. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
19. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
20. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
21. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
22.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
23. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
24. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
25. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
26. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
27. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
28. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
29. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
30. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
31. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
32. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
33. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
34. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
35. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
36. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
37. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
38. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
39. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
40. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
41. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
42. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
43. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
44. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
45. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).","1. 8

16. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
17. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
18. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
19. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
20. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
21. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
22. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
23. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
24. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
25.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
26. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
27. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
28. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
29. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
30. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
31. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
32. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
33. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
34. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
35. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
36. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
37. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
38. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
39. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
40. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
41. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
42. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
43. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
44. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
45. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
2. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
3. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
4. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
5. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
6. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
7. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
8. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
9. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
10. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
11. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
12. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
13. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
14. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
15. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
16. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
17. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
18. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
19. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
20. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
21. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
22. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
23. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
24. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
25. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
26. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
27. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
28. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
29. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
30.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
31. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
32. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
33. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
34. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
35. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
36. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
37. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
38. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
39. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
40. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
41. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
42. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
43. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
44. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
45. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
2. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
3. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
4. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
5. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
6. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
7. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
8. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
9. Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	
10. Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
11. Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
12. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
13. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
14. Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
15. Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
16. It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money.
17. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
18. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
19. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
20. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
21. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
22. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
23. Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
24. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
25. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
26. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
27. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
28. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
29. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
30. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
31. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
32. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
33. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
34. Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
35. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
36. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
37. Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job.
38. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
39. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
40. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
41. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
42. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
43. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
44. Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
45. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. ","1. 8

11. Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains.
12. Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
13. Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
14. Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it.
15. Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
16. You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need.
17. The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
18. Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
19. Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
20. Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
21. There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
22. Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
23. Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
24.  If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it.
25. We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
26. Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question.
27. I don't want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
28. Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
29. I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices.
30. Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine.
31. Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It's better to improve the technologies that we already have.
32. Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
33. Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen.
34. Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. 
35. Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. 
36. Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state.
37. Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
38. Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
39. Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism.
40. Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
41. The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil.
42. If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big.
43. The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage.
44. Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don't understand are just too risky.
45. Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.","1. 4

7. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
8. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
9. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.

12. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.
13. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
14. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
15. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
16. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations

18. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
19. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
20. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
21. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
22. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
23. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
24. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.

26. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
27. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
28. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
29. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
30. Banning pesticides might help the local biodiversity but decreases our food production capacity and autonomy
31. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
32. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
33. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change.

## [Considerations]:
1. The negative effects of the climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
2. We should develop short distribution channels and support local production instead of supporting big agrifood corporations
3. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
4. We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
5. It is important to support smal land local farming as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. 
6. “Actions on the food system in Switzerland will lead to increased imports and shift of the pollution abroad”
7. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
8. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
9. Eating sustainably is too expensive, and only wealthy people can afford it
10. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
11. There's not much point in me doing anything to make agriculture more sustainable. No-one else is going to.
12. I'm not going to do anything to address the impacts of the agri-food system because it is not a major issue.
13. If Switzerland reduces greenhouse gases of its food system it won't make a difference.
14. The Swiss food system depends on imports from other countries, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
15. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
16. It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for food system changes.
17. As long as we use animals in agriculture, it cannot be sustainable
18. Climate warming will ultimately benefit food production globally as plants better growth in higher temperature
19. Agriculture is already very sustainable. Swiss farmers are on the right track
20. Products that use environmentally harmful ingredients, such as palm oil, should be taxed in the same way as tobacco products.
21. “Intensive food production can go along with the protection of the environment and health”
22. “Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules and paperwork. Family farmers should have more liberties”
23. Strong regulation of food production will eventually damage our economic relationship with other countries
24. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Switzerland, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
25. Agricultural subsidies should promote sustainable, pesticide and antibiotic-free production.
26. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
27. I am happy to pay a higher price for local or organic food products
28. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
29. Planning for food system adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. 
30. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
31. Sustainable agriculture increases prices and harms consumer freedom. The production should be adapted to what people demand.
32. There is not enough information to definitively establish if the link between the agri-food system and climate change is real.
33. The community should be involved in discussions about food system adaptation.
34. We need to deal with the water pollution issue through measures such as reducing fertilizer and pesticide use.
35. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
36. Some communities are more affected than others by the global agri-food system, but this is not a priority issue.
37. “Food accessibility (price) and security (availability) is NOT COMPATIBLE with a sustainable food system”
38. The main focus of planning for adaptation should be to prepare the food system for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. 
39. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by intensive use of pesticides/antibiotics
40. The Swiss food system is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
41. We need actions to protect inhabitants and the biodiversity from harmful pesticide.
42. It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by malnutrition and famine.

## [Considerations]:
1. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
2. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
3. We are a democratic country.
4. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. 
5. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
6. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
7. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
8. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
9. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
10. We live in a great democracy.
11. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
12. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
13. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
14. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
15. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
16. I'm always cynical about government processes.
17. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
18. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
19. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
20. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
21. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
22. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. 
23. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
24. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
25. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
26. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
27. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
28. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. 
29. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
30. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
31. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
32. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
33. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
34. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
35. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
36. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
37. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
38. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
39. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
40. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
41. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
42. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
43. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
44. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
45. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
46. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
47. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.

## [Considerations]:
1. Improving working or study conditions does not impact people's mental health in any way.
2. Minors under the age of 16 should be legally prohibited from using social media.
3. Investing in mental health services in schools and workplaces (for example, having social workers in facilities) is essential to prevent negative mental health outcomes.
4. Private mental health services are better than public ones, so Switzerland's mental health system should be entirely privatized.
5. It is good that basic health insurance does not fully cover mental health care since only a few people need it.
6. Being poor, living far from urban centers, or being a victim of racism are examples of factors that can influence a person's willingness to seek help for mental health problems.
7. Individuals should take responsibility for their own mental well-being.
8. Mental health problems are solely medical in nature and not a social issue.
9. Social media platforms should be required to have parental controls.
10. People should take responsibility for actively addressing their own biases and prejudices against individuals with mental health disorders.
11. More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and their accessibility, especially for marginalized people subject to socioeconomic disparities.
12. Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.
13. Social media contribute to mental health issues through cyberbullying, social comparison, and unrealistic portrayals of life.
14. Mental health can be understood in different ways. A comprehensive definition of mental health should take into account social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.
15. Personal solutions (such as joining a yoga club) are more effective than government intervention in addressing mental health issues (such as having social workers or psychologists in schools).
16. Mental health issues require less urgency and fewer resources compared to physical health conditions.
17. Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medication.
18. To prevent people with mental health issues from feeling lonely or isolated, we should talk more about these topics in schools and workplaces to increase public understanding and sensitivity.
19. Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., government media campaigns) is essential to reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions.
20. People with mental disorders should not be allowed to work with children.","1. 1
