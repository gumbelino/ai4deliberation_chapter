cuid,created_at,provider,model,temperature,input_tokens,output_tokens,C1. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.,C2. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.,C3. We are a democratic country.,"C4. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.",C5. We live in a great democracy.,C6. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.,C7. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.,"C8. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.",C9. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.,"C10. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.",C11. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.,C12. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say,C13. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.,C14. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.,"C15. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.","C16. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me","C17. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.",C18. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market,C19. I'm always cynical about government processes.,"C20. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.",C21. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.,C22. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.,"C23. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.","C24. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.","C25. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.",C26. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.,C27. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.,"C28. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.","C29. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.",C30. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.,C31. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.,C32. People get the government they deserve,C33. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.,"C34. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.","C35. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.",C36. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.,C37. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. ,"C38. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.",C39. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.,"C40. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. ","C41. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. ",C42. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. ,"C43. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. ",C44. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. ,C45. There is a lot of consultation by govt â€“ but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?,"C46. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.","C47. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.",C48. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
