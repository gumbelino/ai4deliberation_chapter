Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.,C4. It is difficult to trust scientists' reports on climate change.,C5. It is difficult to trust government reports on climate change.,C6. It is difficult to trust what the media report about climate change.,C7. There is not enough information to conclusively say that climate change is real.,C8. It doesn't make much sense for me to do anything to solve the problem. No one else is doing anything.,"C9. I don't know what to do. I am very worried and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic set of actions that would truly make a difference.","C10. Doing something to reduce emissions seems a bit hopeless to me, but I just want to feel like I'm doing my best.",C11. I believe that the impact we can achieve as individuals in Switzerland is so small that our actions are useless.,C12. I'm not going to do anything about climate change because it's not an important issue.,C13. Authorities should receive additional funding to strengthen measures against emergencies and weather-related disasters such as floods.,C14. We need to take into account the negative effects of climate change on local businesses.,C15. Authorities have the resources they need to effectively adapt to climate change.,C16. The urban heat island effect must be tackled with measures such as planting trees.,"C17. Health systems must prepare for both the physical health impacts of climate change (e.g., heat stroke) and the mental health impacts (e.g., farmers losing their crops).",C18. It is necessary to have strong on-the-ground disaster response capabilities to deal with extreme weather conditions.,"C19. Even if Switzerland were to reduce all its COâ‚‚ emissions, global warming would continue.",C20. The melting of Alpine glaciers is not a real problem for our daily lives.,C21. It is important to focus on adaptation measures that take into account the country's economic future.,C22. Rising insurance costs are a serious problem related to climate change.,"C23. Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to contribute to an effective global solution.",C24. It is important to prepare for the migration of people displaced by the effects of climate change.,C25. We should focus on protecting human systems rather than protecting ecosystems.,C26. Society should be included in the discussion on climate change adaptation.,"C27. Some countries or regions of the world will be more affected by climate change than others, but this is not our top priority.",C28. The planning of measures to tackle climate change should focus primarily on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.,C29. It is NOT necessary to involve society in deciding which key issues are important for climate change adaptation planning.,C30. Planning climate change response measures requires a global approach that considers a wide range of interventions rather than specific individual actions.,C31. There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illnesses and deaths caused by high temperatures.,"C32. It is important to support vulnerable groups (the elderly, children, people with disabilities, low-income individuals) as they have fewer resources to deal with the impacts of climate change."
