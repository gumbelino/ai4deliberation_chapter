cuid,created_at,provider,model,temperature,input_tokens,output_tokens,C1. the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.,C2. the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?,C3. the amalgamation will erease the local diversities,C4. the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete,C5. it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.,"C6. the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality""","C7. with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are.",C8. the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.,C9. we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat,C10. I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine,C11. through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need ,C12. the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing,C13. the fusion is a leap in the unknown,C14. the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes,C15. there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion,C16. the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.,C17. the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union,C18. the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.,C19. the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance,"C20. the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school.","C21. if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services.","C22. through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development.",C23. the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.,C24. the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services,"C25. it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done.",C26. the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else,C27. the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.,C28. the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process,C29. the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.,C30. if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens,"C31. in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune.","C32. the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money",C33. it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna,C34. it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.,"C35. in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way.",C36. with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
