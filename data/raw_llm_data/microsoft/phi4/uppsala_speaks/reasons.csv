This is evident from the highest ranking given to focusing resources on source countries like Romania (#6), which aligns with Considerations #9 and #6. Providing accommodation for beggars also ranks high (#2), reflecting an agreement with Considerations #4 and #21, emphasizing humane treatment and support. Enforcing existing laws without special consideration for beggars is ranked in the middle (#3), indicating a belief that while laws should be upheld, they should not be overly harsh or discriminatory. This aligns with Consideration #42 about not breaking laws due to poverty but recognizes the need for enforcement. The least favored policies are those involving bans and deportation. Banning begging within Sweden (#5) is seen as a superficial solution that does not address underlying issues. Deporting immigrants who beg (#7) is ranked lowest, reflecting a strong disagreement with Considerations #21 and #29, which view such actions as unsympathetic and counterproductive to helping victims of poverty. Overall, the ratings emphasize addressing systemic issues while providing support, enforcing laws fairly, and avoiding punitive measures."

Age ranges: 18-25, 26-35, etc.<|end|> <|assistant|>You can achieve this by first categorizing the respondents into age groups and then calculating a weighted average. Here's how you could modify your code: ```python # Define age ranges age_ranges = [(18, 25), (26, 35), (36, 45), (46, 60), (61, 100)] weights = [] for response in self.questionnaire_responses: for age_range in age_ranges: if age_range[0] <= response.age <= age_range[1]: weight = response.weight # Assuming 'weight' is an attribute of the response break weights.append(weight) # Calculate weighted average for each consideration weighted_agreement_levels = [] for i in range(42): total_weighted_value = 0 total_weight = 0 for j, response in enumerate(self.questionnaire_responses): if response.considerations[i]: total_weighted_value += response.considerations[i] * weights[j] total_weight += weights[j] weighted_agreement_levels.append(total_weighted_value / total_weight if total_weight else 0) self.weighted_agreement_levels = weighted_agreement_levels ``` This assumes each `QuestionnaireResponse` has an `age`, `weight`, and `considerations` attribute. Make sure to adjust as per your actual data structure.<|end|> <|user|>Add temporal analysis, track changes over time, different survey rounds.<|end|> <|assistant|>To add temporal analysis and track changes over different survey rounds, we need to include timestamps for each response and calculate agreement levels for each round. Here's a modified version of the code: ```python from collections import defaultdict # Initialize dictionary to store agreement levels per time period (round) time_period_agreement = defaultdict(lambda: [0] * 42) time_periods_count = defaultdict(int) for response in self.questionnaire_responses: # Determine which time period (survey round) this response belongs to survey_round = response.timestamp.strftime('%Y-%m') # Example: grouping by year and month for i in range(42): if response.considerations[i]: time_period_agreement[survey_round][i] += response.considerations[i] time_periods_count[survey_round] += 1 # Calculate average agreement levels per time period self.time_period_agreement_levels = {} for period, values in time_period_agreement.items(): self.time_period_agreement_levels[period] = [ value / time_periods_count[period] if time_periods_count[period] else 0 for value in values ] ``` This assumes each `QuestionnaireResponse` has a `timestamp` attribute. Adjust the grouping logic (e.g., year and month) as needed.<|end|> <|user|>Detect outliers, remove them from average calc.<|end|> <|assistant|>To detect and remove outliers from the average calculation, you can use statistical methods such as the Z-score or the Interquartile Range (IQR). Here's how you could implement this using IQR: ```python import numpy as np def is_outlier(value, q1, q3): iqr = q3 - q1 lower_bound = q1 - 1.5 * iqr upper_bound = q3 + 1.5 * iqr return value < lower_bound or value > upper_bound # Calculate agreement levels excluding outliers agreement_levels_no_outliers = [] for i in range(42): considerations_i = [response.considerations[i] for response in self.questionnaire_responses if response.considerations[i]] # Calculate Q1 and Q3 q1, q3 = np.percentile(considerations_i, [25, 75]) # Filter out outliers filtered_values = [ value for value in considerations_i if not is_outlier(value, q1, q3) ] if filtered_values: avg_agreement_level = sum(filtered_values) / len(filtered_values) else: avg_agreement_level = 0 agreement_levels_no_outliers.append(avg_agreement_level) self.agreement_levels_no_outliers = agreement_levels_no_outliers ``` This code assumes you have NumPy installed (`pip install numpy`). The `is_outlier` function determines if a value is an outlier based on the IQR method."
