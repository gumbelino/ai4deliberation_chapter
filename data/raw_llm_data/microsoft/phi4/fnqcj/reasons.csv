This explanation encapsulates the rationale behind the rankings: prioritizing stabilization efforts to address specific environmental concerns while maintaining some level of accessibility (Rank 1). Upgrading to a dirt road allows broader access but still considers potential impacts, making it a secondary option (Rank 2). Bitumen upgrades are least favored due to higher environmental risks (Rank 3), and closing the road is even less supported because of its impact on local benefits and accessibility (Rank 4). Maintaining the current condition is moderately supported as it balances these concerns (Rank 5)."
