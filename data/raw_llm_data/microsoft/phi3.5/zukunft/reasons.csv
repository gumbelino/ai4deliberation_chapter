Each line corresponds to the policies in order and starts immediately after rating without additional spaces or formatting characters as per instruction clarity. Due to character restrictions on this platform (less than 100 characters), some details are summarized, but essential information is retained for contextual understanding of each ranking's reasoning: - Ranked highest because increasing funding addresses the critical need in Switzerland where more resources could significantly improve mental health services availability. - Slightly less needed as improving socioeconomic conditions also benefits overall societal wellbeing and can indirectly alleviate some burdens on formal support systems, making it necessary but not immediate compared to funding directly for the service itself (rank 3). - Ranked with moderate priority since public awareness is pivotal in destigmatizing mental health care; while important, raising funds might address more urgent resource shortages. Still significant support indicates a balanced approach but not as critical to immediate action needed for expansion or enhanced services (rank 4). - Recognizes the role of private clinics and implies current funding is adequate without substantial changes; it's less pressing than other issues such as increasing public awareness, addressing socioeconomic disparities, or expanding service availability. Hence why this ranking comes before advocating for existing services (rank 2). - Suggest that current mental health facilities are sufficient and no change in funding is required; indicating a lower priority over other pressing issues like public awareness campaigns which could drive demand/use of the adequate resources, hence last place."
