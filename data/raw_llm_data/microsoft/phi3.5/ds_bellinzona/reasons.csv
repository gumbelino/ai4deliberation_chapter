(Note: The explanation provided here is a synthesis of the ratings into one line, condensing my viewpoint on each policy based on their perceived importance and effectiveness as suggested by the scores. Each number represents an increasing level of support for reducing CO₂ emissions; with 1 being least supported due to potential economic impacts.)"
